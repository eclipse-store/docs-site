This method will work if and only if there is only one JCache implementation available in the classpath. If there are multiple providers then use the fully qualified name + Caching.getCachingProvider(\"org.eclipse.store.cache.types.CachingProvider\") instead. Get the default CacheManager instance using the provider. Create a cache configuration using MutableConfiguration with key type and value type as Integer and String respectively configured to store the cache entries by reference (not by value) and with an expiry time of one minute defined for entries from the moment they are created. Using the cache manager, create a cache named jCache with the configuration created in step 3. Put some data into the cache And retrieve it. The same can be done using EclipseStore’s CacheConfiguration API. This time we use a EmbeddedStorageManager as a backing store for the cache. EmbeddedStorageManager storageManager = EmbeddedStorage.start(); CachingProvider provider = Caching.getCachingProvider(); CacheManager cacheManager = provider.getCacheManager(); CacheConfiguration configuration = CacheConfiguration .Builder(Integer.class, String.class, \"jCache\", storageManager) .expiryPolicyFactory(CreatedExpiryPolicy.factoryOf(Duration.ONE_HOUR)) .build(); Cache cache = cacheManager.createCache(\"jCache\", configuration); cache.put(1, \"one\"); String value = cache.get(1);","title":"Getting Started","component":"manual","version":"1","name":"getting-started","url":"/manual/1/cache/getting-started.html","titles":[{"text":"Prerequisites","hash":"_prerequisites","id":1},{"text":"Hello World","hash":"_hello_world","id":2}]},"2":{"id":2,"text":"EclipseStore provides a JCache (JSR-107) implementation, which is optionally backed by a EclipseStore Storage. JCache standardizes caching for the Java platform. It provides a common mechanism to cache values in a map-like structure. It expedites the mainstream adoption of in-memory computing by giving all Java developers an easy way to access memory from within Java. Businesses can change providers without rewriting their applications or maintaining a proprietary cache abstraction layer. This caching standard is used in a wide variety of environments. The most common use cases are: Second-level cache in JPA (e.g. Hibernate) Spring Cache Abstraction and many more Why another JCache implementation, you may wonder. There is already a myriad of providers out there. EclipseStore’s very own serialization and storage can be utilized to get the best out of caches. For example, you are not limited to java.io.Serializable types, when storing a value. That means every key-value pair gets copied every time you put and get entries in and out of a cache. And if a cache is used with a backing store, EclipseStore’s storage can be used to get the best possible performance. And now, EclipseStore being a JCache provider, you can use it as a drop-in replacement in your existing application. The caching provider represents the implementation of JCache that you are using. You can use more than one JCache implementation in your project if you wish, and CachingProvider is how you access the different providers that are in use. It is responsible for managing and providing access to many named caches. The cache holds the different values being cached. You can have several caches, each of which may be holding data for a different purpose. Each one can have a different configuration; for example, different caches may evict old data using different techniques. Each item of data in a cache is an entry, which is a key-value pair. The key is a unique value used to store and look up the data. The value is the actual data you wish to cache. Caches have some different properties than Maps, but the calls that you would use to store and lookup data is very similar.","title":"Cache","component":"manual","version":"1","name":"index","url":"/manual/1/cache/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Motivation","hash":"_motivation","id":1},{"text":"Basic Concepts of JCache","hash":"_basic_concepts_of_jcache","id":2},{"text":"CachingProvider","hash":"_cachingprovider","id":3},{"text":"CacheManager","hash":"_cachemanager","id":4},{"text":"Cache","hash":"_cache","id":5},{"text":"Entry","hash":"_entry","id":6}]},"3":{"id":3,"text":"EclipseStore provides a module for simple object based network communication over TCP connections. This module utilizes the Eclipse Serializer engine to serialize and deserialize Java objects and provides additional APIs to setup the required TCP connections. If using Maven, just add module communication-binary into your pom.xml dependencies. pom.xml org.eclipse.serializer communication-binary 1.4.0 The Hello World example consists of two applications. The Host and the Client application. The host will open a network port and listen for incoming connections from the client. If a client connects successfully, it awaits data from the client that will be sent back to the client. The basic example won’t do any configuration, so the connection is not secured, and the client and host use the local system address at port 1099. public class EchoServer { public static void main(final String[] args) { final ComHost host = ComBinaryDynamic.Foundation() .setHostChannelAcceptor(channel -> { final Object received = channel.receive(); System.out.println(\"received: \" + received); channel.send(received); }) .createHost(); // run the host, making it constantly listen for new connections and relaying them to the logic host.run(); } } public class EchoClient { public static void main(final String[] args) { //create the client final ComClient client = ComBinaryDynamic.Foundation() .createClient(); //connect to the host and communicate try(final ComChannel channel = client.connect()) { channel.send(\"Hello Host\"); final Object received = channel.receive(); System.out.println(\"received: \" + received); } } } Configuration of host and client is done using the ComFoundation.Default implementation of the ComFoundation interface. To get a preconfigured foundation instance, the classes ComBinaryDynamic and ComBinary provide the convenient method Foundation(). The Object communication of Eclipse Serializer is available in two flavours: Dynamic and non-dynamic. They differ in the way classes that should be serialized and transferred are handled: The non-dynamic version requires all classes that should be transferred to be registered at initialization time. This can be done with the registerEntityType methods of the ComFoundation. If a transferred object graph references any unregistered class, an exception will occur! The dynamic implementation automatically registers all classes that are part of the communication at runtime. It will also do a type-mapping if classes with the same name have different implementations on the client and host. host binding address The host’s IP address is configured with ComFoundation.setHostBindingAddress(InetSocketAddress). client target address The address the client connects to is configured by ComFoundation.setClientTargetAddress(InetSocketAddress). port only If no host or client target address is configured, it is possible to use ComFoundation.setPort(int) to set a port that is used together with the default IP addresses for the host and client. registering entity types to register entity types at startup, use ComFoundation.registerEntityTypes(Class…​) for example.

This API is part of the persistence-binary module: pom.xml org.eclipse.serializer serializer 1.4.0 You can use any medium type, but for most purposes, the byte array version should be sufficient to transfer the serialized form over the transport layer of your choice. Simply create a serializer instance, optionally based on a foundation, and call the serialize and deserialize methods. final SerializerFoundation foundation = SerializerFoundation.New() .registerEntityTypes(Customer.class); final Serializer serializer = Serializer.Bytes(foundation); byte[] data = serializer.serialize(customer); Customer restored = serializer.deserialize(data); The serializer uses the EclipseStore’s type handling system. This includes registration of new types on demand during serialization and legacy type mapping when deserializing. The SerializerFoundation provides an API like the MicroStream storage to configure the type handling behavior. The default Serializer implementation does not include type information in the serialized output! If you want to deserialize that with another serializer instance, you must register all classes using the SerializerFoundation before you create the serializer or use a TypedSerializer! The serializer internally generates a dictionary that describes all serialized types. This dictionary can be exported and imported to exchange those type informations between different serializer instances. The current type information can be obtained as Sting using the serializers exportTypeDictionay() method: final String typeDictionaryString = serializer.exportTypeDictionay(); To import an initial type dictionary, it must be supplied as a String. The SerializerFoundation offers methods to import that type dictionary string before the serializer instance is generated: Using the static New(String typeDictionaryString) Method: final SerializerFoundation foundation = SerializerFoundation.New(typeDictionaryString); Using the setInitialTypeDictionary(String typeDictionaryString) method: final SerializerFoundation foundation = SerializerFoundation.New(); foundation.setInitialTypeDictionary(typeDictionaryString); The TypedSerializer implementation includes type information into the serialized output. By default, the complete set of type information is included in all serialized output. final Serializer serializer = TypedSerializer.Bytes(foundation); byte[] data = serializer.serialize(customer); Customer restored = serializer.deserialize(data); To reduce the serialized data, it is possible to configure the included type information by supplying a SerializerTypeInfoStrategyCreator to the SerializerFoundation. final SerializerFoundation foundation = SerializerFoundation.New() .setSerializerTypeInfoStrategyCreator( new SerializerTypeInfoStrategyCreator.IncrementalDiff(false)); return TypedSerializer.Bytes(foundation); Property Description TypeDictionary Includes type information for all types currently known to the serializer, including those registered during the setup. Diff Includes type information for all types currently known to the serializer, including those registered during the setup. IncrementalDiff Includes only type information for types added to the serializers type registry in the current serialization. Types that are registered during the serializer’s setup are never included. All three serializer type handling strategies allow specifying that the type information gets included only once if it has not changed by setting the parameter includeTypeInfoOnce = true. If so, the type information is only included if new types are registered during the current serialization.","title":"Serializer","component":"manual","version":"1","name":"index","url":"/manual/1/serializer/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Prerequisites","hash":"_prerequisites","id":1},{"text":"Usage","hash":"_usage","id":2},{"text":"Type handling","hash":"_type_handling","id":3},{"text":"TypeDictionary","hash":"_typedictionary","id":4},{"text":"Exporting the type dictionary","hash":"_exporting_the_type_dictionary","id":5},{"text":"Importing the type dictionary","hash":"_importing_the_type_dictionary","id":6},{"text":"TypedSerializer","hash":"_typedserializer","id":7},{"text":"Configuring the included type information","hash":"_configuring_the_included_type_information","id":8},{"text":"Available options are:","hash":"_available_options_are","id":9},{"text":"The includeTypeInfoOnce parameter:","hash":"_the_includetypeinfoonce_parameter","id":10}]},"9":{"id":9,"text":"Actually, a database is a passive collection of persisted data that can never be live on its own. But the managing thread accessing it can. When an EmbeddedStorageManager is \"started\" it is actually just setup with all kinds of default and user-defined settings and definitions. What is actually \"started\" are the database managing threads that process storing and loading requests. // Setup the database manager and start the managing threads EmbeddedStorageManager storageManager = EmbeddedStorage.start(); Of course, for every start() method, there needs to be something like a shutdown() method. So there is in EclipseStore: // Stop accessing the database storageManager.shutdown(); But is it really necessary to call shutdown? Should it be? What if there’s an error and the process stops without calling shutdown()? Will that cause the database to become inconsistent, corrupted, maybe even destroyed? The answer is: It wouldn’t be much of a database solution if a crash could cause any problem in the persisted data. EclipseStore data-store is carefully designed in such a fashion that the process it runs in can simply vanish at any point in time and the persisted data will never be corrupted. This is surprisingly simple and reliable to solve: Whenever a .store() call returns, it is guaranteed that the data stored by it has been physically written to the underlying storage layer, usually a file system. Before that, there is no guarantee regarding written data at all. In fact, should the process die before the last byte has been written and secured, the next StorageManager initialization will recognize that and truncate the last partially written store. Either way, all the data that was guaranteed to be written will be consistently available after the next .start(). As a consequence, this safety mechanism makes an explicit .shutdown() call pretty much unnecessary. It doesn’t hurt, but it is effectively more-less the same as just calling System.exit(0);. The only time when an explicit shutdown is really needed is, if the database managing threads shall be stopped but the application itself keeps running. For example, it is perfectly valid to start the StorageManager, work with the database, then stop it, maybe change some configuration or copy files or something like that and then start it up again to continue working. In any other case, the shutdown method can be ignored and the live database can happily just be \"killed\" while running. It is specifically designed to withstand such a treatment. Any live EclipseStore database basically consists of three major parts: A place where the persisted data is located. Usually a file system directory. The managing threads accessing (read and write) the persisted data. The EmbeddedStorageManager instance to use and control the database in the application. Apart from a lot of internal components (configuration, processing logic, housekeeping state, etc.), that’s all there is. There is nothing special or \"magic\" about it, no static state, no global registration in the JVM process or something like that. The consequence of this is: If two EmbeddedStorageManager instances are started, each one with a different location for its persistend data, then the application has two live databases! If three or ten or 100 are started, then that’s the number of live databases the application has. There is no limit and no conflict between different databases inside the same application process. The only important thing is that no two running StorageManagers can access the same data location.","title":"Application Life-Cycle","component":"manual","version":"1","name":"application-life-cycle","url":"/manual/1/storage/application-life-cycle.html","titles":[{"text":"Stopping or Crashing a Live Database","hash":"_stopping_or_crashing_a_live_database","id":1},{"text":"Multiple Databases","hash":"_multiple_databases","id":2}]},"10":{"id":10,"text":"Deleting data does not require performing explicit deleting actions like DELETE FROM table WHERE…​.

In line 6 the current storage’s content is printed. Line 7 assigns some data to the storage, replacing existing data if there is some. In line 8 everything gets stored. When using EclipseStore, your entire database is accessed starting at a root instance. This instance is the root object of an object graph that gets persisted by the EclipseStore storage logic. While the root instance can be of any type (for example just a collection or an array), it is a good idea to define an explicit root type specific for the application. In this simple example, it is a class called DataRoot, which wraps a single String. public class DataRoot { private String content; public DataRoot() { super(); } public String getContent() { return this.content; } public void setContent(final String content) { this.content = content; } @Override public String toString() { return \"Root: \" + this.content; } } For further information, see root instances.

It is comprised of mechanisms for cleaning up storage files, clearing unneeded cached data and recognizing deleted entities via garbage collection. Housekeeping is performed with a configurable time budget in configurable intervals to make sure it never interferes with the application’s work load too much (see housekeeping configuration). If new versions of an entity are stored or if entities become no longer reachable (meaning the become effectively deleted or \"garbage\" data), their older data is no longer needed. However, the byte sequences representing that old data still exist in the storage files. But since they will never be needed again, they become logical \"gaps\" in the storage files. Space that is occupied, but will never be read again. It might as well be all zeroes or not exist at all. Sadly, unwanted areas cannot simple by \"cut\" from files. Above all because that would ruin all file offsets coming after them. So with every newly stored version of an entity and every entity that is recognized as unreachable \"garbage\", a storage file consists more and more of useless \"gaps\" and less and less of actually used data. This makes the storage space less and less efficient. To prevent eventually ending up with a drive that is filled with useless bytes despite an actually not that big database, the files need to be \"cleaned up\" from time to time. To do this, the Housekeeping occasionally scans the storage files. If their \"payload\" ratio goes below the configured limit, the affected files will be retired: all data that belongs to still live entities is copied to a new file. Then the old file consists of 100% unneeded gap data and can safely be deleted. Which ratio value to set in the configuration is a matter of taste or, more precisely, depends on each individual application’s demands. A value of 1.0 (100%) means: only files with 100% payload, so no gaps at all, are acceptable. This means that for every store that contains at least one new version of an already existing entity, the corresponding storage file will contain the slightest gap, thus dropping below the demanded ratio of 100% and as a consequence, will be retired on the next occasion. This very aggressive cleanup strategy will keep the disc space usage at a perfect minimum, but at the cost of enormous amounts of copied data, since virtually every store will cause one or more storage files to be retired and their content be shifted into a new file. Respectively, a value of 0.0 (0%) means something like: \"Never care about gaps, just fill up the disc until it bursts.\" This keeps the disc write loads for the file cleanup at 0, but at the cost of rapidly eating up disc space. The best strategy most probably lies somewhere in between. Somewhere between 0.1 and 0.9 (10% and 90%). The default value is 0.75 (75%). So a storage file containing up to 25% of unused gap data is okay. Containing more gaps that 25% will cause a storage file to be retired. In addition to the payload ratio check, the file cleanup also retired files tha are too small or too big. For example: The application logic might commit a single store that is 100 MB in size. But the storage files are configured to be no larger than 10 MB (for example to keep a single file cleanup nice and fast). A single store is always written as a whole in the currently last storage file. The reason for this is to process the store as fast as possible and quickly return control to the application logic. When the housekeeping file cleanup scan encounters such an oversized file, it will retire it immediately by splitting it up across 10 smaller files and then deleting the oversized file. A similar logic applies to files that are too small. Upper and lower size bounds can be freely configured to arbitrary values. The defaults are 1 MB and 8 MB. To avoid repeated reads to storage files (which are incredibly expensive compared to just reading memory), data of once loaded entities is cached in memory. If an entity’s cached data is not requested again for a certain amount of time in relation to how much data is already cached, it is cleared from the cache to avoid unnecessarily consuming memory. The mechanism to constantly evaluate and clear cached data where applicable, is part of the housekeeping. The aggressiveness of this mechanism can be configured via the housekeeping configuration. In a reference-based (or graph-like) data paradigm, instances never have to be deleted explicitly. For example, there is no \"delete\" in the java language. There are only references. If those references are utilized correctly, deleting can be done fully automatically without any need for the developer to care about it. This is called \"garbage collection\". The concept is basically very simple: when the last reference to an instance is cut, that instance can never be accessed again. It becomes \"garbage\" that occupies memory with it data that is not needed any longer. To identify those garbage instances, all an algorithm (the \"garbage collector\") has to do is to follow every reference, starting at some defined root instance (or several) of a graph and mark every instance it encounters as \"reachable\". When it has no more unvisited instances in its queue, the marking is completed. Every instance that is not marked as reachable by then must be unreachable garbage and will be deleted from memory. Similar to the JVM’s garbage collection to optimize its memory consumption, EclipseStore has a garbage collection of its own, but for the level of persistent storage space instead of memory space. Housekeeping can also be triggered manually from the StorageConnection . Related methods are: issueCacheCheck(nanoTimeBudgetBound) issueCacheCheck(nanoTimeBudgetBound, entityEvaluator) issueFileCheck(nanoTimeBudgetBound) issueFileCheck(nanoTimeBudgetBound, fileDissolvingEvaluator) issueFullCacheCheck() issueFullCacheCheck(entityEvaluator) issueFullFileCheck() issueFullFileCheck(fileDissolvingEvaluator) issueFullGarbageCollection() issueGarbageCollection(nanoTimeBudget) All Housekeeping methods can be given a defined time budget or can be run until full completion.","title":"Housekeeping","component":"manual","version":"1","name":"housekeeping","url":"/manual/1/storage/housekeeping.html","titles":[{"text":"File cleanup:","hash":"_file_cleanup","id":1},{"text":"Cache cleanup","hash":"_cache_cleanup","id":2},{"text":"Garbage collection","hash":"_garbage_collection","id":3},{"text":"Explicit Housekeeping","hash":"_explicit_housekeeping","id":4}]},"13":{"id":13,"text":"EclipseStore provides an API to import and export persisted data of the storage.

From a technical point of view it serves one purpose only: To fully or partially persist and restore a Java object graph in the simplest way possible for the user. EclipseStore is a storage engine, but no database management system (DBMS). Many features that typical DBMS provide have been left out on purpose. The reason is that those features exist to make a DBMS something of a server application platform of an \"old kind\" on top of its data store functionality: A standalone process with user management, connection management, session handling, often even with a programming language of its own, a querying interface (SQL), etc. Today, all of those server application features are already and much better handled by dedicated server applications (the \"new kind\"), implemented in a modern language like Java. They have their built-in user, connection and session management, the querying interface to the outside world are typically web services instead of SQL, etc. But those modern server applications still lack one important thing: an easy to use and technically efficient way to store and restore their application’s data. So a \"new kind\" server often uses an \"old kind\" server just to do the data storing. This comes at the price of catching all the overhead and problems of redundant user, connection and session management AND the outdated concepts and limitations of the old querying interface (SQL). Isn’t that very weird and frustratingly complicated? Why not simply include a modern data storing library in the modern server and be done with it? A storing library that perfectly fits the modern technology and brings in no redundant overhead or complication of a secondary outdated wannabe server process. This is exactly what EclipseStore is and the reason why it is intentionally not a DBMS but \"only\" a storage engine. One might think the easiest way to store and load data in Java would be Java’s built-in serialization. However, it turned out long ago to be very limited, making it hard, if not impossible, to be used as a replacement for a DBMS: Only complete object graphs can be stored and restored, which is unacceptable for all but very small databases. It is very inefficient in terms of storage size and performance. It does not handle changing class structures very well, basically forbidding classes of persisted entities to ever change or introducing massive manual effort to compensate. It cannot handle third-party classes that do not implement Serializable but cannot be changed. In short: The Java Serialization is not an acceptable data store solution and hence no valid replacement for those outdated DBMS. EclipseStore is such a solution: It can persist, load or update object graphs partially and on-demand. It is very efficient both size- and performance-wise. It handles changing class structures by mapping data in the old structure to the current structure during loading; implicitly via internal heuristics or explicitly via a user-defined mapping strategy. It can automatically handle any Java constructs, only excluding those that are technically or reasonably not persistable (e.g. lambdas, proxies or instances with ties to JVM-internals like threads, etc.). EclipseStore is what the Java Serialization should have been and it is the first and only really fitting data storing solution for modern applications, completely removing the need to attach a wannabe secondary server DBMS just to store data.","title":"Storage","component":"manual","version":"1","name":"index","url":"/manual/1/storage/index.html","titles":[]},"15":{"id":15,"text":"The EclipseStore engine takes care of persisting your object graph.

One value after another as a trivial byte stream. References between objects are mapped with unique numbers, called ObjectId, or short OID. With both combined, byte streams and OIDs, an object graph can be stored in a simple and quick way, as well as loaded, as a whole or partially. But there is a small catch. Where does it start? What is the first instance or reference at startup? Strictly speaking \"nothing\". That’s why at least one instance or a reference to an instance must be registered in a special way, so that the application has a starting point from where the object graph can be loaded. This is a \"Root Instance\". Same difference, another problem are instances which are references by constant fields in Java classes. These aren’t created when the records are loaded from the database, but by the JVM while loading the classes. Without special treatment, this would be a problem: The application, meaning the JVM or the JVM process, starts, the constant instances are created by the JVM, one or more of them are stored, then the application shuts down. The stored data of the constants are now stored with a certain OID in the database. The application starts again. The Constant instances are created again by the JVM. The data records are read by EclipseStore. The problem is: How should the application know what values, which are stored with a certain OID, belong to which constant? The JVM created everything from scratch at startup and doesn’t know anything about OIDs. To resolve this, the constant instances must be registered, just like the entity graph’s root instance. Then EclipseStore can associate the constant instances with the stored data via the OIDs. Constant instances can be thought of as JVM-created implicit root instances for the object graph. In both cases, root and constant instances, it is about registering special starting points for the object graph in order to load it correctly. For EclipseStore, from a plain technical view, both cases don’t make a difference. In the most common cases, nothing at all. The default behavior is enough to get things going. By default, a single instance can be registered as the entity graph’s root, accessible via EmbeddedStorage.root(). Therefore, this is already a fully fledged (although tiny) database application: // Start the database manager EmbeddedStorageManager storageManager = EmbeddedStorage.start(); // Set the entity (graph) as root storageManager.setRoot(\"Hello World\"); // Store root storageManager.storeRoot(); If you are working with EclipseStore technology in a multi-threaded environment, there are a few things you need to pay extra attention to. When using standard frameworks, you often work in a multi-threaded environment. If you are using the older JDBC approach, you create a copy of your data that you work with within a single thread, modify the data, and then save it back in a database trace. EclipseStore works with data directly, allowing it to achieve significantly better performance parameters. However, for developers, this means that any reading and writing to this shared object graph must be synchronized. To make it easier to use within your application, we have prepared a simple way for you to do so. XThreads.executeSynchronized(() -> { root.changeData(); storageManager.store(root); }); This approach will immediately provide you with several benefits: Any changes to your object graph will be synchronized, every other thread will see the current value. Avoid Deadlocks In principle, you prevent the object graph from being modified at the same time it is saved. The simple default approach has its limits when the application defines an explicit root instance that must be updated/filled from the database directly during database initialization. Something like this: // Empty application-specific root, to be filled during start() MyApplicationRoot root = new MyApplicationRoot(); // Start the database manager EmbeddedStorageManager storage = EmbeddedStorage.start(); // root must be filled at this point... but how? root.printAllMyEntities(); To solve this, a custom root instance can be directly registered at the database setup. In the simplest case, is just has to be passed to .start();: // Empty application-specific root, to be filled during start() MyApplicationRoot root = new MyApplicationRoot(); // Start the database manager with a reference to the application's root. EmbeddedStorageManager storageManager = EmbeddedStorage.start(root); // root is \"magically\" filled at this point. (Yay!) root.printAllMyEntities(); Internally, the two concepts (default root and custom root) and handled by different mechanisms. This can be seen from the two different methods storageManager.defaultRoot(); storageManager.customRoot(); The simplified method storageManager.root(); automatically chooses the variant that is used. Since neither of those three methods can know the concrete type of the root instance (and adding a type parameter just for that would have been a complication overkill), they all can only be typed to return Object. So, to avoid annoying and dangerous casts, it is best to keep a direct reference to a custom root instance as shown in the code snippet above. Likewise, storageManager.storeRoot(); works for both variants, so there is no need to worry about how to store which one.","title":"Root Instances","component":"manual","version":"1","name":"root-instances","url":"/manual/1/storage/root-instances.html","titles":[{"text":"What Must Be Done in the Application?","hash":"_what_must_be_done_in_the_application","id":1},{"text":"Shared Mutable Data","hash":"_shared_mutable_data","id":2},{"text":"Synchronize access to shared mutable data","hash":"_synchronize_access_to_shared_mutable_data","id":3},{"text":"Custom Root Instances","hash":"_custom_root_instances","id":4}]},"17":{"id":17,"text":"The default way to configure a JCache provider is to use the class javax.cache.configuration.MutableConfiguration.

It is available within this artifact: pom.xml org.eclipse.store eclipse-store-integrations-cdi4 1.4.0 The integration requires the javax namespace and requires a CDI 4.0 implementation and an Eclipse MicroProfile Config 2.0 implementation. This CDI extension makes use of the Extension interface and the BeanManager functionality, so it might not work in a strict Jakarta EE 10 Core Profile product that only supports the CDI Lite functionality. The configuration of the StorageManager can be done using key/value pairs that are provided by MicroProfile Config. The configuration keys must be prefixed by org.clipse.store org.eclipse.store.storage-directory=/opt/data/eclipsestore org.eclipse.store.channel-count=2 Since the - character is not supported in some sources (like the environment variables), you can also define the configuration keys using the . character. org.eclipse.store.storage.directory=/opt/data/eclipsestore org.eclipse.store.channel.count=2 Besides that, the regular MicroProfile Config rules about keys are applied (since we are using MicroProfile Config directly, see specification). The configured and started StorageManager is a CDI bean and thus can be injected or retrieved programmatically. @Inject private StorageManager storageManager; public void someMethod() { StorageManager storageManager = CDI.current().select(StorageManager.class).get(); } The StorageManager configuration can be customized by CDI beans that implement the interface org.eclipse.store.integrations.cdi.types.config.EmbeddedStorageFoundationCustomizer. The customize method is called with an EmbeddedStorageFoundation which allows you to fully customize the StorageManager that will be created. You can for example, add the specific Type Handlers for JDK 8 as described on the documentation. After the StorageManager is created, the CDI beans that implement org.eclipse.store.integrations.cdi.types.config.StorageManagerInitializer are called. You have the opportunity to perform actions on the StorageManager or root object. Following rules apply to the StorageManager that is passed to the initialize method of the interface. The StorageManager is already started unless you specified the configuration value org.eclipse.store.autoStart=false. If you have used the @Storage annotation on a class, the StorageManager is already associated with an instance of that class as the Root object. There is a second option to configure and retrieve the StorageManager, and it makes use of the EclipseStore functionality to read the configuration from any file. @Inject @ConfigProperty(name = \"org.eclipse.store.ini\") private StorageManager storageManager; The above construct makes use of the MicroProfile Config functionality that you convert the value of the key org.eclipse.store.ini and convert it into a StorageManager. The value of the key is expected to point to an existing file. The formats XML, INI, and properties are supported. The StorageManager is also fully configured and started just as you would use it when using the first option of configuration. If you define it multiple times, within different beans, for example, you always receive the same instance of the StorageManager when you specify the same value for the name member of the @ConfigProperty annotation. This way, you can define and use multiple _StorageManager_s within your application. The customizer and initializer features described earlier as CDI beans implementing a specific interface are also available when you use the MicroProfile Config annotation (@ConfigProperty). Since you can define multiple StorageManager_s this way, you can distinguish between them based on the _database name. The database name can be set by using the following property within the configuration file (example makes use of the properties format, but it is also supported in the other formats) database-name=theName If this property is not specified, the value of the MicroProfile config key (used within the name member of @ConfigProperty) is used. Within the customizer and initializer, you can use this to perform the required actions based on the instance you receive. EmbeddedStorageFoundation.getDataBaseName(); StorageManager.databaseName(); The root object can be indicated by using the @Storage annotation on the class. This annotation converts the POJO into a CDI bean (there is no need to use any scope-defining annotation) with Application Scope. This is only supported when you inject the StorageManager without making use of the MicroProfile Config @ConfigProperty annotation. Besides converting it into a CDI bean, any field injection within this class is also resolved. The integration also defines the instance of the class that is created as the root object (StorageManager.setRoot()) and stores the initial value (StorageManager.storeRoot()) when storageManager does not have a root object assigned yet (this happens only the very first time when you start up your application and the storage doesn’t contain any data yet) The POJO must have a (default) no-argument constructor so that the integration can create an instance of it. You can only annotate 1 class with the @Storage annotation, if you have marked multiple, the deployment of your application will fail at the CDI validation phase.","title":"CDI Extension","component":"manual","version":"1","name":"cdi","url":"/manual/1/misc/integrations/cdi.html","titles":[{"text":"Configuration","hash":"_configuration","id":1},{"text":"Root object","hash":"_root_object","id":2}]},"23":{"id":23,"text":"Various EclipseStore integrations are currently available.

The Spring Boot integration provides a set of Bean Factories which read the configuration and initialize the relevant EclipseStore facilities for you, including EmbeddedStorageManager. The simplest way to use this integration is when you can externalize all the configuration using Spring configuration files. Subsequently, you just create a Spring Boot application and add a dependency on the integration. Then, in the Bean where you need access to the StorageManager, you add the @Autowired annotation and a StorageManager is created for you.

This behavior can be changed using the following configuration. org.eclipse.store.auto-create-default-storage=false org.eclipse.store.auto-create-default-foundation=false You can have a more than one Storage Manager in your application. This can be useful if you want to have different storage targets for different data. For example, you might want to have a datastore for your user data and another for your product data. You can do this by creating multiple configuration classes and multiple Storage Managers. @Configuration public class TwoBeanConfiguration { @Autowired private EmbeddedStorageFoundationFactory foundationFactory; @Autowired private EmbeddedStorageManagerFactory managerFactory; @Bean(\"first_config\") @ConfigurationProperties(\"org.eclipse.store.first\") EclipseStoreProperties firstStoreProperties() { return new EclipseStoreProperties(); } @Bean(\"second_config\") @ConfigurationProperties(\"org.eclipse.store.second\") EclipseStoreProperties secondStoreProperties() { return new EclipseStoreProperties(); } @Bean @Qualifier(\"first_storage\") EmbeddedStorageManager createFirstStorage(@Qualifier(\"first_config\") final EclipseStoreProperties firstStoreProperties) { return managerFactory.createStorage( foundationFactory.createStorageFoundation(firstStoreProperties), firstStoreProperties.isAutoStart() ); } @Bean @Qualifier(\"second_storage\") EmbeddedStorageManager createSecondStorage(@Qualifier(\"second_config\") final EclipseStoreProperties secondStoreProperties) { return managerFactory.createStorage( foundationFactory.createStorageFoundation(secondStoreProperties), secondStoreProperties.isAutoStart() ); } } The configuration properties are defined in the application.properties file with appropriate prefixes. org.eclipse.store.first.storage-directory=${java.io.tmpdir}/${random.int} org.eclipse.store.first.auto-start=false org.eclipse.store.first.root=org.eclipse.store.integrations.spring.boot.types.storages.FirstRoot org.eclipse.store.second.storage-directory=${java.io.tmpdir}/${random.int} org.eclipse.store.second.auto-start=false org.eclipse.store.second.root=org.eclipse.store.integrations.spring.boot.types.storages.SecondRoot EclipseStore supports mutex locking. This is useful if you have multiple processes that need to access the same objects. Easiest way to use it is to use the annotation @read and @write on the methods that need to be locked. The annotation @read is used for methods that only read data and @write is used for methods that modify data. To activate mutex locking, you need to add the following dependency to Maven pom.xml of your SpringBoot application: pom.xml org.springframework.boot spring-boot-starter-aop Then you can use the Mutex Locking in your code: @Component public class SomeStorageImpl implements SomeStorage { @Read public String getSomethingById(Integer Id) { // Read something from the storage } @Write public void addSomething(String something) { // Add something to the storage } } If you have larger object graph, you can consider to add more Mutexes and lock different parts of the object graph. This can be done by adding the @Mutex annotation to the class. The parameter of this annotation is the name of the mutex. If you have multiple classes with the same mutex name, they will be locked together. @Component @Mutex(\"jokes\") public class JokesStorageImpl implements JokesStorage { } EclipseStore Spring module supports standard Spring logging, so you can add this into your config: logging.level.org.eclipse.store=debug to obtain all EclipseStore configuration keys: 15:57:34.923 [main] DEBUG o.e.s.i.s.b.t.EclipseStoreProviderImpl -- EclipseStore configuration items: 15:57:34.923 [main] DEBUG o.e.s.i.s.b.t.EclipseStoreProviderImpl -- storage-directory : jokes_storage 15:57:34.923 [main] DEBUG o.e.s.i.s.b.t.EclipseStoreProviderImpl -- channel-count : 2 15:57:34.923 [main] DEBUG o.e.s.i.s.b.t.EclipseStoreProviderImpl -- auto-start : true Key values containing \"password\" are replaced by \"xxxxx\". Handler for JDK 17 are registered automatically. Handler for JDK 8 are not registered automatically, because of the backwards compatibility. If you create a new storage you can enable these handlers. If you have an existing storage created with JDK8 handlers, you have to active it too. If you need to register JDK 8 handlers, you can do it by adding the following code to your configuration: org.eclipse.store.register-jdk8-handlers=true If you are interested in using the EclipseStore REST service in your application, consider to include the SpringBoot REST Service. Detailed documentation can be found at Setup of Spring Boot REST Service. You can include the Client GUI application to be directly as a module served by your application. For this purpose, include the SpringBoot Console to your application classpath. We assume that you are starting Spring MVC in your application already. Please add the following dependency to Maven pom.xml of your SpringBoot application: org.eclipse.store integrations-spring-boot3-console {maven-version} In order to operate properly, Client GUI requires a working SpringBoot REST Service. This is already prepackaged in the console module and needs to be activated. In addition, the path to the Client GUI needs to be configured. Please set the following properties in your configuration file: org.eclipse.store.rest.enabled=true vaadin.url-mapping=/store-console/* The Client GUI will start with your application and will be available at the specified URL. So if your SpringBoot application starts a web server on port 8080 the Client GUI will be available at: http://localhost:8080/store-console/. Open this URL in your browser, select from the dropdown list the endpoint of the Spring REST Service (http://localhost:8080/store-data/) and click connect.","title":"Spring Boot Integration","component":"manual","version":"1","name":"spring-boot","url":"/manual/1/misc/integrations/spring-boot.html","titles":[{"text":"Configuration","hash":"_configuration","id":1},{"text":"StorageManager injection","hash":"_storagemanager_injection","id":2},{"text":"Example:","hash":"_example","id":3},{"text":"Configuration Injection","hash":"_configuration_injection","id":4},{"text":"Autostart","hash":"_autostart","id":5},{"text":"Disable Auto StorageManager creation","hash":"_disable_auto_storagemanager_creation","id":6},{"text":"Multiple Storage Managers","hash":"_multiple_storage_managers","id":7},{"text":"Mutex Locking","hash":"_mutex_locking","id":8},{"text":"Logging","hash":"_logging","id":9},{"text":"Register JDK 17 and JDK 8 Handlers","hash":"_register_jdk_17_and_jdk_8_handlers","id":10},{"text":"Activating REST Service SpringBoot","hash":"_activating_rest_service_springboot","id":11},{"text":"Activating Client GUI","hash":"_activating_client_gui","id":12}]},"26":{"id":26,"text":"The layered entities code generator is an annotation processor, provided by the codegen-entity module.

This also allows the actual data instance to be immutable, while at the same time leaving referential integrity of an entity graph intact. Ready-to-use logic layers are provided for: Logging Versioning While the layers admittedly introduce considerable technical complexity and runtime overhead, this concept is a production ready solution for nearly all requirements regarding cross cutting concerns and aspects. To use this concept in your code, there need to be at least implementations for the entity’s identity and data. Let’s say the entity looks like this: public interface Person extends Entity { public String firstName(); public String lastName(); } There needs to be an identity class: public class PersonEntity extends EntityLayerIdentity implements Person { protected PersonEntity() { super(); } @Override protected Person entityData() { return (Person)super.entityData(); } @Override public final String firstName() { return this.entityData().firstName(); } @Override public final String lastName() { return this.entityData().lastName(); } } And a data class: public class PersonData extends EntityData implements Person { private final String firstName; private final String lastName ; protected PersonData(final Person entity, final String firstName, final String lastName ) { super(entity); this.firstName = firstName; this.lastName = lastName ; } @Override public String firstName() { return this.firstName; } @Override public String lastName() { return this.lastName; } } A lot of code to write to get an entity with two properties!

All types in the public API are, whenever possible, interfaces. This offers the best possibilities to extend or exchange parts of the engine. A good ways to enrich a type with features, is the wrapper (decorator) pattern. For example, let’s say we want to add logging to the PersistenceStoring's store(object) method. PersistenceStoring.java public interface PersistenceStoring { public long store(Object instance); public long[] storeAll(Object... instances); public void storeAll(Iterable instances); public void storeSelfStoring(SelfStoring storing); } Conventionally it would be done that way: A new type, implementing the original interface, would be handed over the wrapped instance, all interface methods have to be implemented and delegated. And in the single method, we wanted to add functionality; the actual implementation of the logging is done. public class PersistenceStoringWithLogging implements PersistenceStoring { private final PersistenceStoring wrapped; public PersistenceStoringWithLogging(final PersistenceStoring wrapped) { super(); this.wrapped = wrapped; } @Override public long store(final Object instance) { Logger.getLogger(PersistenceStoring.class.getName()) .info(\"Object stored: \" + instance); return this.wrapped.store(instance); } @Override public long[] storeAll(final Object... instances) { return this.wrapped.storeAll(instances); } @Override public void storeAll(final Iterable instances) { this.wrapped.storeAll(instances); } @Override public void storeSelfStoring(final SelfStoring storing) { this.wrapped.storeSelfStoring(storing); } } This produces a lot of overhead. In this case, three methods are just boilerplate code to delegate the calls to the wrapped instance. A common solution for that is to create an abstract base wrapper type for the designated interface, and to reuse it whenever needed. public abstract class BaseWrapperPersistenceStoring implements PersistenceStoring { private final PersistenceStoring wrapped; public BaseWrapperPersistenceStoring(final PersistenceStoring wrapped) { super(); this.wrapped = wrapped; } @Override public long store(final Object instance) { return this.wrapped.store(instance); } @Override public long[] storeAll(final Object... instances) { return this.wrapped.storeAll(instances); } @Override public void storeAll(final Iterable instances) { this.wrapped.storeAll(instances); } @Override public void storeSelfStoring(final SelfStoring storing) { this.wrapped.storeSelfStoring(storing); } } And then, based on that, the implementation of the logger type would look like this: public class PersistenceStoringWithLogging extends BaseWrapperPersistenceStoring { public PersistenceStoringWithLogging(PersistenceStoring wrapped) { super(wrapped); } @Override public long store(Object instance) { Logger.getLogger(PersistenceStoring.class.getName()) .info(\"Object stored: \" + instance); return super.store(instance); } } That’s better. No more boilerplate code. Just overwrite the methods you want to extend. The only work left is, to generate the base wrapper types. One way is to let your IDE generate the wrapper or delegation code. Disadvantage of that is, it has to be redone every time your interfaces change. A code generator, which does it automatically would be nice. And that’s what the base module brings along.

Time for the house keeping interval. House keeping tasks are, among others: Garbage Collection Cache Check File Cleanup Check In combination with housekeeping-time-budget, it can be specified how many CPU time should be used for house keeping. E.g. interval=1000ms and budget=10000000ns means every second there’s 0.01 seconds time for house keeping, so max 1% CPU time used for house keeping. This CPU time window is only used if house keeping work is pending. If nothing has to be done, no time is wasted. Time used for each housekeeping cycle. However, no matter how low the number is, one item of work will always be completed. But if there is nothing to clean up, no processor time will be wasted. Default is 10000000 (10 million nanoseconds = 10 milliseconds = 0.01 seconds). However, no matter how small the time is, one item is done at least. This is to avoid no-ops, if a too small time window is configured. This time budget is a \"best effort\" threshold, meaning when at 1ns left, a huge file has to be cleaned or the references of a huge collection have to be marked for GC, then this budget can be exceeded considerably. For further information see Housekeeping. Minimum file size in bytes of a storage file to avoid merging with other files during housekeeping. Must be greater than 1, maximum is 2GB. Maximum file size in bytes of a storage file to avoid splitting in more files during housekeeping. Must be greater than 1, maximum is 2GB. Due to internal implementation details files larger than 2GB are not supported! The ratio (value in ]0.0;1.0]) of non-gap data contained in a storage file to prevent the file from being dissolved. \"Gap\" data is anything that is not the latest version of an entity’s data, including older versions of an entity and \"comment\" bytes (a sequence of bytes beginning with its length as a negative value length header). The closer this value is to 1.0 (100%), the less disk space is occupied by storage files, but the more file dissolving (data transfers to new files) is required and vice versa. Maximum file size for each channels transactions log file. If this limit is exceeded the file wile be cleaned up during housekeeping. To shrink the file size all store, transfer, and truncation entries are combined into one single store entry for each storage files. FileCreation entries are kept, FileDeletion entries are kept if the storage data file still exists on the file system. Otherwise all entries related to deleted files are removed if the storage data file does no more exist. Default is 100 MB. Maximum value is 1 GB.

Since there is a limitation in EclipseStore that you can have only one manager that is connected to one data storage, you can bypass this restriction with this read-only mode. But there are limitations, such as: In read-only mode, you cannot write to a data storage. This means calls to .store() and other methods resulting in a write will throw an exception. In read-only mode, the housekeeping processes do not run since that would corrupt the data storage because two managers operate on the same 'files'. In read-only mode, your data root is filled on startup of the manager as usual, and lazy references operate as normal. However, there is no notification mechanism that the underlying data storage has changed, and the Storage Manager only remembers the structure of the data storage as it was when it started. The last bullet point is important. It indicates that when another Storage Manager writes some new data, this new data never gets picked up by this read-only manager. When the other Storage Manager housekeeping process removes a file or reorganizes a file as cleanup, an exception will be thrown as the structure is changed but still expected by the read-only manager. So, the read-only manager can only be used to read some data but should be closed 'soon' after starting, and a new manager should be created if you need to read data later on.

This is useful to optimize the performance for storing complex objects or in the rare case that it is not possible to store a type with the default type handlers. There are two strategies for a simplified type handler implementation. Implementing a class that extends CustomBinaryHandler and defines a sequence of BinaryFields via the #Field~ static pseudo-constructor methods. Everything else like setting the name, calculating the binary offsets, etc. is then done implicitly via reflection. Example on GitHub This example implements a custom type handler for the java.awt.image.BufferedImage class. Instead of storing the rather complex object structure of that class the image is serialized as PNG image format using javax.imageio.ImageIO into a byte array. This byte array is then stored by EclipseStore. The custom type handler must be registered in the CustomTypeHandlerRegistry to enable it: EmbeddedStorageManager storage = EmbeddedStorage .Foundation(WORKINGDIR) .onConnectionFoundation(f -> f.registerCustomTypeHandlers(new CustomBufferedImageHandler()) ) .start(ROOT); Implementing a class can be skipped altogether by using the method Binary#TypeHandler and passing the BinaryFields directly. Registering such a generically created TypeHandler is not required. Just define a static method in the entity class that will be recognized and used by EclipseStore. The following is a simple technical example on how a custom binary handler can be easily defined and technically leveraged to optimize storage behavior.

This renders the application and the database incompatible. It’s like in an IDE. You change the structure of a class and the tooling takes care of the rest. Problem is, in a database, the \"rest\" can be, in some circumstances, several gigabytes or even more, that have to be refactored and written again. It’s one way to do it, but there are better alternatives. At best, the data is transformed when it’s accessed only. The old (legacy) type data is being mapped to the new type when it’s being loaded, hence: Legacy Type Mapping. Nothing needs to be rewritten. All records are, as they were saved, compatible with all other versions of their type. Simply by mapping while loading. What has to be done to achieve this? In the most common cases, nothing! The heuristic attempts to automatically detect which fields are new, have been removed, reordered or altered. Contact.java (old) public class Contact { String name ; String firstname; int age ; String email ; String note ; Object link ; } Contact.java (new) public class Contact { String firstname ; // moved String lastname ; // renamed String emailAddress ; // renamed String supportNode ; // renamed PostalAddress postalAddress; // new int age ; // moved } Console Output ---------- Legacy type mapping required for legacy type 1000055:Contact to current type 1000056:Contact Fields: java.lang.String Contact#firstname -1.000 ----> java.lang.String Contact#firstname java.lang.String Contact#name -0.750 ----> java.lang.String Contact#lastname java.lang.String Contact#email -0.708 ----> java.lang.String Contact#emailAddress java.lang.String Contact#note -0.636 ----> java.lang.String Contact#supportNode [***new***] PostalAddress Contact#postalAddress int Contact#age -1.000 ----> int Contact#age java.lang.Object Contact#link [discarded] --- Write 'y' to accept the mapping. The fields in the Contact entity class have been renamed, reordered, one was removed, one is new. What the heuristic is doing now is something like this: String firstname is equal in both classes, so it has to be the same, pretty much as int age. name and lastname is pretty similar, type is the same too. If there is nothing better for the two, they probably belong together. Same with the other two fields. In the end, the ominous link and postalAddress remain. The heuristic can not make sense of that, so it assumes that one thing falls away and the other one is added. In this particular example, that worked perfectly. Well done, heuristic. But: Just as people can make mistakes in estimating similarities (\"I would have thought …​\"), even programs can make mistakes as soon as they logically go on thin ice. There is nothing more with absolute correctness that you actually know from (bug-free) software. Such a similarity matching will be correct in the most cases, but sometimes it will also fall by the wayside. Example: perhaps only PostalAddress instances were referenced in the application under link and the two fields would actually be the same, only now properly typed and named. How should heuristics know that? Nobody could know that either, if he is not privy to the details of the concrete application. That’s why Legacy Type Mapping has two mechanisms that prevent things from going wrong: A callback interface is used to create the desired mapping result: PersistenceLegacyTypeMappingResultor Optionally, an explicit mapping can be specified, which is then preferred to the heuristic approach. If you do not want that, you can simply set another resultor. Like in this example each suspected mapping is submitted once to the user for control in the console. This is done with the InquiringLegacyTypeMappingResultor. Maybe even one, where the user can \"rewire\" the mapping itself, write out the mapping, and then return an appropriate result. EmbeddedStorageFoundation foundation = EmbeddedStorage.Foundation(myDataDir); foundation.getConnectionFoundation().setLegacyTypeMappingResultor( InquiringLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New( PersistenceLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New() ) ); EmbeddedStorageManager storageManager = foundation.createEmbeddedStorageManager(myRoot).start(); All you need is two columns of strings: from old to new. By default EclipseStore uses a CSV file, but you can also write something else. In the end, a lot of string pairs for \"old → new\" mappings have to come into the program somewhere. The concept is simple: If there are two strings, this is interpreted as a mapping from an old thing to a new thing. If the second value is missing, it is interpreted as an old thing to be deleted. Missing the first value, then it’s as a new thing. Why call it \"thing\"? Because this applies to several structural elements: Constant identifier Class names Field names Example: count; articleCount means: the field named earlier count is called articleCount in the current version of the class. count; means: the early field count should be ignored during the mapping. More specifically, the values ​​of this field per record. ;articleCount means, this is a newly added field, DO NOT try to match it with anything else heuristically. You can also mix explicit mapping and heuristics. Only explicitly specify so many changes until the analysis gets the rest right by itself. That means you never have to specify the annoying trivial cases explicitly. Only the tricky ones. Usually, nothing should be necessary at all, or maybe a view indications at most to avoid mishaps. However, those who strictly prefer to make any change explicitly, instead of trusting a \"guessing\" software, can also do that. No problem. For class names, the three variants map, add and remove are somewhat tricky in meaning: Map is just old → new, same as with fields. To make an entry for a new class doesn’t make sense. It’s covered by the new class itself. You can do it, but it has no effect. Marking a removed class as deleted makes no sense either, except one special case. It is not required to specify the fields mapping of mapped classes if the mapping heuristic can do a correct field mapping. Especially if classes have been renamed only. Classes are simply referred to by their full qualified class name: com.my.app.entities.Order In some cases you need to specify the exact Version of the class, then the TypeId has to be prepended: 1012345:com.my.app.entities.Order Mapping from old to new: com.my.app.entities.Order;com.my.app.entities.OrderImplementation For fields it’s a bit more complex. To unambiguously refer a field, the full qualified name of its defining class has to be used. com.my.app.entities.Order#count;com.my.app.entities.Order#articleCount The # is based on official Java syntax, like e.g. in JavaDoc. If inheritance is involved, which must be uniquely resolved (each class in the hierarchy can have a field named \"count\"), you must also specify the declaring class. Like this: com.my.app.entities.Order#com.my.app.entities.ArticleHolder#count; ⤦ com.my.App.entities.Order#com.my.app.entities.ArticleHolder#articleCount A simple example: OldContact.java package com.my.app.entities; public class OldContact { String name ; String firstname; int age ; String email ; String note ; Object link ; // to be discarded } NewContact.java package com.my.app.entities; public class NewContact { String firstname ; // moved String lastname ; // renamed String emailAddress ; // renamed String supportNote ; // renamed PostalAddress postalAddress; // new int age ; // moved } refactorings.csv old current com.my.app.entities.OldContact com.my.app.entities.NewContact com.my.app.entities.OldContact#firstname com.my.app.entities.NewContact#firstname com.my.app.entities.OldContact#name com.my.app.entities.NewContact#lastname com.my.app.entities.OldContact#email com.my.app.entities.NewContact#emailAddress com.my.app.entities.OldContact#note com.my.app.entities.NewContact#supportNote com.my.app.entities.NewContact#postalAddress com.my.app.entities.OldContact#age com.my.app.entities.NewContact#age com.my.app.entities.OldContact#link EmbeddedStorageFoundation foundation = EmbeddedStorage.Foundation(dataDir); foundation.setRefactoringMappingProvider( Persistence.RefactoringMapping(Paths.get(\"refactorings.csv\")) ); EmbeddedStorageManager storageManager = foundation.createEmbeddedStorageManager(root).start(); So far so good, all classes and fields are getting mapped, automatically or manually. But what about the data? How are the values getting transformed from old to new? Technically speaking it’s done fully automatic. But there are some interesting questions: What if the primitive types changes? What if primitives change to references and vice versa? How fast is it? Let’s say int to float. Just to copy the four bytes would yield wrong results. It has to be converted, like float floatValue = (float)intValue; Can it be done? Yes, fully automatic. The class BinaryValueTranslators does the job for you, it has a converter function from each primitive to another. Currently EclipseStore supports conversion between primitives and their wrapper types, and vice versa. When converting a wrapper to a primitive, null is converted to 0. If you need special conversions between object types, you can add custom BinaryValueSetter for that, see customizing. How fast is that? The type analysis happens only once during initialization. If no exception occurs, the Legacy Type Mapping is ready-configured for each necessary type and will then only be called if required. For normal entity classes that are parsed by reflection, legacy type mapping loading is just as fast as a normal load. An array of such value translator functions is put together once and they are run through each time they are loaded. With legacy mapping, only the order and the target offsets are different, but the principle is the same as with normal loading. For custom handlers an intermediate step is necessary: ​​First put all the old values ​​together in an order that the custom handler expects and then read the binary data normally, as if loading a record in the current format. That’s necessary because EclipseStore can’t know what such a custom handler does internally. If someone ever uses such a custom handler, the small detour is not likely to be noticeable in terms of performance. And if it should be the case and it has a negative effect on the productive operation: No problem, because: Of course you can also write a custom legacy type handler. It would run at full speed even with tricky special cases. Of course there is the possibility, as always, of intervening in the machinery massively with customizing. If you need the highest possible performance for some cases, or for logging / debugging, or anyway: Register any value translator implementations. In the simplest case this is 1 line of code, so do not worry. Being able to specify refactoring mapping in a different way than a CSV file is another example. You can even customize (extend or replace) the strategy that is looked up in refactoring mapping. Furthermore, you can also replace the heuristic logic with your own. This is easier than it sounds. This is just a primitive little interface (PersistenceMemberSimilator) and the default implementation thereof calls e.g. just a Levenshtein algorithm for names. You can certainly do that 10 times more clever. Or \"more appropriate\" for a particular application or programming style. E.g. utilize annotations. The basic statement is: If there is a problem somewhere, whether with the heuristic or a special case request or performance problem loading a gazillion entities all at once, or if there is a need for debugging in depth or something like that: do not panic. Most likely, this is easily possible with a few lines of code. Customizing examples You can not just mark classes as deleted. As long as there are records of a certain type in the database, the corresponding class must also exist so that the instances from the database can be loaded into the application. If there are no more records, then that means that there are only a few bytes of orphaned description in the type dictionary, but nobody cares. Is it possible to delete it by hand (or rather not, there are good reasons against it) or you can just ignore it and leave it there forever. In both cases, you must not mark a class as deleted. Now the special case: In the entity graph (root instances and all recursively reachable instances from there) all references to instances of a certain type are filled in. It’s done by the application logic or possibly by a specially written script. That is, all instances of this type are unreachable. No instance is available, no instance can ever be reloaded. This means that the type is \"deleted\" from the database at the logical level. One does not have to register anywhere, that is implicitly just like that. You can actually delete the corresponding Java class from the application project because it will never be needed again during the loading process at runtime. So far so good. There is only one problem: even if the instances are never logically accessible again: the data records are still around in the database files. The initialization scans over all database files, registers all entities, collects all occurring TypeIds and ensures for every TypeId that there is a TypeHandler for it. If necessary, a LegacyTypeHandler with mapping, but still: there must be a TypeHandler for each TypeId. And a TypeHandler needs a runtime type. That is, ass-backwards, over records that are logically already deleted, but only physically still lying around, now it is again enforced that the erasable entity class must be present. Bummer. One can prevent this: there is a \"cleanup\" function in the database management logic, which cleans up all logical gaps in the database files (actually copies all non-gaps into a new file and thus deletes the old file altogether). You would have to call it, then all physical occurrences of the unreachable records disappear and you could easily delete the associated class. But that is annoying. That is why it makes sense for these cases - and only for them - to do the following: If you as a developer are absolutely sure that no single instance of a given class is ever reachable again, i.e. must be loaded, then you can mark a type as \"deleted\" (rather \"unreachable\") in the refactoring mapping. Then the Type Handling will create a dummy TypeHandler that does not need a runtime class. See PersistenceUnreachableTypeHandler. But be careful: if you are mistaken and an instance of such a type is still referenced somewhere and eventually loaded later at runtime, then the Unreachable handler will throw an exception. At some point during the runtime of the application, not even during initialization. The cleanup provides real security: remove all logical gaps and if then with a deleted class no more error in the initialization occurs, it is really superfluous. Any ideas, such as simply returning null in the dummy type handler instead of an instance, are a fire hazard: it may dissolve some annoying situations pleasantly, but it would also mean that existing datasets, potentially entire subgraphs, become hidden from the application. Nevertheless, the database would continue to drag them along, perhaps becoming inexplicably large, and any search for the reason would yield nothing, because the dummy type handler keeps the data records secret. Shortsighted great, but catastrophic in the long run. That’s not good. The only clean solution is: you have to know what to do with your data model. As long as there are still available instances, they must also be loadable. The annoying special case above can be defused without side effects. But it can not be more than that, otherwise it will get rid of the chaos, problems and lost confidence in the correctness of the database solution.","title":"Legacy Type Mapping","component":"manual","version":"1","name":"index","url":"/manual/1/storage/legacy-type-mapping/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Automatic Mapping","hash":"_automatic_mapping","id":1},{"text":"Explicit Mapping","hash":"explicit-mapping","id":2},{"text":"Explicit Mapping of Classes","hash":"_explicit_mapping_of_classes","id":3},{"text":"Explicit Mapping Syntax","hash":"_explicit_mapping_syntax","id":4},{"text":"Value Conversion","hash":"_value_conversion","id":5},{"text":"Value Conversion of Primitives","hash":"value-conversion-of-primitives","id":6},{"text":"Value Conversion of References / Objects","hash":"value-conversion-of-references","id":7},{"text":"Performance","hash":"performance","id":8},{"text":"Customizing","hash":"customizing","id":9},{"text":"Special Case: Deleted Class","hash":"special-case-deleted-class","id":10}]},"61":{"id":61,"text":"Here is an overview of how to enable and configure different levels of user interaction for the Legacy Type Mapping.

Incidentally, that’s not a JDBC connection, but this is just one thing that creates helper instances like Storer and Loader. Because Legacy Type Mapping affects loading, it has to go in there. Either you access it directly, like this: EmbeddedStorageConnectionFoundation f = foundation.getConnectionFoundation(); Or like this, that’s better for method chaining. foundation.onConnectionFoundation(f -> { ... }); If you have that, the configuration for the Legacy Type Mapping callback logic is just a one liner: f.setLegacyTypeMappingResultor(...); Default PersistenceLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New() That’s just the necessary logic, without anything further. If you do not change anything, this is done by default. With Console Output PrintingLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New(PersistenceLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New()) That wraps a printer around the necessary logic.

And so on With the implementation of just one single interface method, you can build anything else you can imagine. For example, logging to a file instead of the console. Or in the personally preferred logging framework. Or write confirmed mappings into the refactorings file. Everything is possible. For the inquiring implementation (InquiringLegacyTypeMappingResultor) there are a few settings: When should he ask? Always or only if something is unclear. Never does not make any sense of course, then you shouldn’t use it, or alternatively the printing resultor. When is a mapping unclear? If at least one field mapping is not completely clear. A field mapping is clear if: If two fields are exactly the same (similarity 1.0 or 100%) Or if two fields are specified by the explicit mapping. So if all fields are clear according to the above rule, then there is no need to ask. And there is another special case: If a field is discarded that is not explicitly marked as discardable, then as a precaution an inquiry is always done. Although no data is lost, but the data would not be available in the application, so better ask. There are options to control this a bit finer. You can optionally specify a double as a threshold (from 0.0 to 1.0, otherwise Exception): The value determines how similar two matching fields automatically have to be so that they are not inquired. Example: The value is 0.9 (90%), but a match found is only 0.8 (80%) similar. This is according to the specification too little, there must be an inquiry as a precaution. If you specify 1.0, that means: always ask, everything is really perfectly clear. If you enter 0.0, this means: never ask or only for implicitly dropping fields. Looks like this: InquiringLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New( PersistenceLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New()) // implicitely 1.0 InquiringLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New( PersistenceLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New(), 0.7) // 0.7 threshold Here a small example with a Person class. int customerid ; // -> pin String firstname ; // -> firstName String surname ; // -> lastName String comment ; // discarded, NOT new commerceId It should be changed to: Integer pin ; // firstName surname -0,688----> lastName comment -0,750----> commerceId [***new***] address customerid [discarded] customerid and pin are too different to be automatically assigned to each other. Therefore, it is wrongly assumed that customerid is omitted and pin is new. comment and commerceId are surprisingly similar (75%) and are therefore assigned. But that’s not what we want. Incidentally, it would not matter here what is defined as a threshold: customerid would be eliminated by the implicit decision. This is too delicate not to inquire, so it is always necessary to ask. To get the mapping right, you have to specify two entries: customerid is now called pin and comment should be omitted Then the inquiry looks like this: customerid -[mapped]-> pin firstname -0,944----> firstName surname -0,688----> lastName [***new***] commerceId [***new***] address comment [discarded] Due to the explicit mapping from customerid to pin, the similarity does not matter, it is the mapping that matters. To indicate this, it says \"[mapped]\" instead of the similarity. The rest is as usual. Only comment is now \"[discarded]\", according to the mapping. The difference to the above is namely: This is an explicitly predetermined absence. That does not force inquiry. This clears the way for the threshold: If you enter 0.7 or more then you will be asked. As far as everything would be clear, but the mapping of surname to lastName is below the required \"minimum similarity\", so rather ask. If you enter 0.6 or less, you will no longer be asked. Because all assignments are either explicitly specified or they are according to \"minimum similarity\" similar enough to rely on it. A recommendation for a good value for the \"minimum similarity\" is difficult. As soon as one softens rules, there is always the danger of a mistake. See comment example above: is 75% similar to commerceId. Still wrong. Then prefer 80%? Or 90%? Of course it is better, but the danger is still there. If you want to be sure, just make 1.0 or omit the parameter, then by default 1.0 is taken. The most important is the explicit mapping anyway : if \"enough\" is given by the user, there is no need to ask.","title":"User Interaction","component":"manual","version":"1","name":"user-interaction","url":"/manual/1/storage/legacy-type-mapping/user-interaction.html","titles":[]},"62":{"id":62,"text":"Loading data can be done in two ways, eager and Lazy.

The developer doesn’t have to worry about data synchronization and then store this data in a database transaction. This way of working is very practical, it does not require developers to have knowledge of multi-threaded programming and thanks to this it is very widespread. Can similar technical work be used when working with EclipseStore? Of course, elegantly, very simply and safely we can use the ObjectCopier utility to create a deep copy of our data, change it, and save it back. Very simple idea, just create a purchase of actual data to work within the application and at the end save that data back. Unfortunately, it’s not that simple. If the standard copy function is called over an object in Java, it creates a copy of that object, but the other object’s references remain the same. This doesn’t help so much. Because usually, an application contains a more complex data structure than a single object. This approach is called shallow copy. More here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying What is actually needed at this point is a deep copy. You need to create a complete copy of the complete subgraph from this object. EclipseStore provides full support for a deep copy. It can be relatively easily called and a deep copy of the data will be created. The ObjectCopier is part of the eclipse serializer. pom.xml org.eclipse.serializer serializer 1.4.0 To create a deep copy just create a ObjectCopier and use its copy method.

Just create an instance of ObjectCopier class with factory method New(); Get the customer Make a deep copy of the customer object Modify this object graph In synchronized mode save this customer instead of the original customer and store it into a datastore This simple example written in pseudocode aims to demonstrate one of the many ways to solve working over a shared object graph in a multi-threaded environment.

You only need to call the store method on the correct object. The rule is: \"The Object that has been modified has to be stored!\". Storing objects that are not part of an object graph is most likely pointless. See Getting Started how to create a database with a root instance. To store the registered root instance just call the storeRoot() method of a EmbeddedStorageManager instance. // Init storage manager final EmbeddedStorageManager storageManager = EmbeddedStorage.start(root); // Store the root object storageManager.storeRoot(); To store a newly created object, store the \"owner\" of the object.

When called, the reference held in the Lazy Reference is removed and only the ID is kept so that the instance can be reloaded when needed. Important background knowledge: However, such a clear does not mean that the referenced instance immediately disappears from memory. That’s the job of the garbage collector of the JVM. The reference is even registered in another place, namely in a global directory (Swizzle Registry), in which each known instance is registered with its ObjectId in a bijective manner. This means: if you clear such a reference, but shortly thereafter the Lazy Reference is queried again, probably nothing has to be loaded from the database, but simply the reference from the Swizzle Registry is restored. Nevertheless, the Swizzle Registry is not a memory leak, because it references the instances only via WeakReference. In short, if an instance is only referenced as \"weak,\" the JVM GC will still clean it up. So that the Lazy References do not have to be managed manually, but the whole goes automatically, there is the following mechanism: Each Lazy instance has a lastTouched timestamp. Each .get() call sets it to the current time. This will tell you how long a Lazy Reference has not been used, i.e. if it is needed at all. The LazyReferenceManager audits this. It is enabled by default, with a timeout of 1,000,000 milliseconds, which is about 15 minutes. A custom manager can be set easily, which should happen before a storage is started.

Instead, you only load a tiny amount of \"head data\" for each area (name or other for displaying purposes) and the actual data only when the application really needs it. E.g. fiscal years with hundreds of thousands or millions of sales. One million revenue records for 2010, one million for 2011, for 2012, etc. In 2019, most of the time only 2019 and 2018 will be needed. The previous few, and the year 2000 sales are not of great interest anymore. Therefore: load data only when needed. Super efficient. For example let’s say the app \"MyBusinessApp\" has a root instance class, looking like this: public class MyBusinessApp { // ... private HashMap businessYears = new HashMap<>(); // ... } The business year hold the turnovers: public class BusinessYear { // ... private ArrayList turnovers = new ArrayList<>(); // ... } This approach would be a problem: During initialization, the root instance would be loaded, from there its HashMap with all BusinessYear instances, each with its ArrayList and thus all conversions. For all years. 20 years of approximately 1 million sales makes 20 million entities, which are pumped directly into the RAM at the start. It does not matter if someone needs it or not. We don’t want it that way. It would be nice if you could simply add a \"lazy\" to the turnover list. And that’s exactly how it works: public class BusinessYear { // ... private Lazy> turnovers = ...; // we will get to that // ... } And bingo, the turnovers are now loaded lazily. Of course, this is no longer an ArrayList field, which is now magically loaded lazy, but this is now a Lazy field and the instances of this type are typed generically to ArrayList . Lazy is just a simple class whose instances internally hold an ID and a reference to the actual thing (here the ArrayList instance). If the internal reference is zero, the reserved ID is used to reload it. If it is not null, it is simply returned. So just a reference intermediate instance. Similar to the JDK’s WeakReference, just not JVM-weak, but storage-lazy. What do you have to do now to get the actual ArrayList instance? ArrayList turnovers = this.turnovers.get(); Just as with WeakReference, or simply as one would expect from a reference intermediate type in general: a simple get method. The .get() call reloads the data as needed. But you do not want to mess around with that yourself. No \"SELECT bla FROM turnovers WHERE ID =\" + this.turnovers.getId(). Since you want to program your application you don' t have to mess around with low-level database ID-loading stuff. That’s what the EclipseStore Code does internally. You do not even need to access the ID, you just have to say \"get!\". That’s it. There are different strategies, what you write here. Analogous to the code example before it would be simply: private Lazy> turnovers = Lazy.Reference(new ArrayList<>()); So always a new ArrayList instance, wrapped in a Lazy instance. If the actual ArrayList reference should be null at first, it works the same way: private Lazy> turnovers = Lazy.Reference(null); The this.turnovers.get() also just always returns null. Completely transparent. But you could also do this: private Lazy> turnovers = null; If there is no list, then you do not make any intermediate reference instance for any list. A separate instance for null is indeed a bit …​ meh. But that has a nasty problem elsewhere: this.turnovers.get() does not work then. Because NullPointerException. Anytime you need to write this here, the readability of code is not exactly conducive: return this.turnovers == null ? null : this.turnovers.get(); But there is a simple solution: Just move this check into a static utility method. Just like that: return Lazy.get(this.turnovers); This is the same .get(), just with a static null-check around it. This always puts you on the safe side. For Lazy Loading, simply wrap Lazy<> around the actual field and then call .get() or maybe better Lazy.get(...). It’s as simple as that. The full example can be found on GitHub. Why do you have to replace your actual instance with a lazy loading intermediate instance and fiddle around with generics? Why is not something like this: @Lazy private ArrayList turnovers = new ArrayList<>(); Put simply: If it were just that it would be bare Java bytecode for accessing an ArrayList. There would be no way for a middleware library to get access and look it up and perhaps reload it. What’s written there is an ArrayList reference. There is no lazy anymore. Either, the instance is null, or it is not null. If you wanted to reach in there, you would have to start with bytecode manipulation. Technically possible, but something you really don’t want in your application. So there must always be some form of intermediary. Hibernate solves this through its own collection implementations that do lazy loading internally. Although the lazy loading is nicely hidden in some way (or not, if you need an annotation for that), it also comes with all sorts of limitations. You can only use interfaces instead of concrete classes for collections. At first, the instance is not the one you dictate, the code becomes non-transparent and difficult to debug, you have to use a collection, even if it’s just a single instance, and so on. You want to be able to write anything you want and you want full insight and control (debugability, etc.) over the code. All this can be done with the tiny Lazy Interim Reference class. No restrictions, no incomprehensible \"magic\" under the hood (proxy instances and stuff) and also usable for individual instances.","title":"Lazy Loading","component":"manual","version":"1","name":"index","url":"/manual/1/storage/loading-data/lazy-loading/index.html","titles":[{"text":"What about the \"…​\" ?","hash":"_what_about_the","id":1},{"text":"In Short","hash":"_in_short","id":2},{"text":"Side Note","hash":"_side_note","id":3}]},"79":{"id":79,"text":"A List, Map, or Set is a single entity within $EclipseStore. So this means that all data are loaded at once into memory. This can be an issue if you have a very large collection, like a list with several millions of Customers. That is why we recommend splitting up large lists using an indexing strategy like a HashMap that contains a Lazy list of data as value. Or, when more advanced functionality is required, you can make use of an Apache Lucene index that efficiently determines which data needs to be loaded. The Lazy collections that are added to the library can help you to maintain a larger block of data in a more memory-efficient way. The implementation might need to load and unload data (when there is not enough memory), so access time to the data might be slightly increased. No additional configuration is required to make use of these Lazy Collections. The Binary Handlers to correctly write and read the Lazy Collections to and from the data storage are already configured by default. When you need to instantiate an instance, you can just call the default constructor. The instance you receive implements the standard Java collection interface that you expect based on the name of the class. new LazyArrayList(); new LazyHashSet(); new LazyHashMap(); The default constructor takes a value of 1000 items in each segment. This is not a hard limit since various factors, like the hash collision with a Map, can result in the fact that more elements are maintained in a segment. You can specify the number of items that should be maintained by specifying this value as a constructor parameter. Note that small values, like smaller than 100, or large values, like 1_000_000 and more, might negatively impact the performance. As mentioned, the implementation stores the data in different segments which are lazily operated. Initially, at the startup of the StorageManager, the data is not yet loaded into memory and your object graph. When accessing the values, it loads the required segments to fulfil your request. Depending on how you access the data, it might be that all segments need to be loaded. Since they behave like Lazy objects, they can be unloaded by the Garbage collector if needed when the memory consumption of your Java application is high. Some aspects of the implementations The size property is cached, so calling for the amount of data in the collection doesn’t need to load the segments. Accessing the LazyHashMap by a key value will load at maximum log2(n) segments when the implementation uses n segments since the search is implemented as btree.","title":"Lazy collections","component":"manual","version":"1","name":"lazy-collections","url":"/manual/1/storage/loading-data/lazy-loading/lazy-collections.html","titles":[{"text":"Background","hash":"background","id":1},{"text":"Configuration","hash":"config","id":2},{"text":"Using","hash":"use","id":3},{"text":"Internals","hash":"_internals","id":4}]},"80":{"id":80,"text":"For convenience EclipseStore provides Null-safe static access methods for lazy references.

Create a cache configuration using MutableConfiguration with key type and value type as Integer and String respectively configured to store the cache entries by reference (not by value) and with an expiry time of one minute defined for entries from the moment they are created. Using the cache manager, create a cache named jCache with the configuration created in step 3. Put some data into the cache And retrieve it. The same can be done using EclipseStore’s CacheConfiguration API. This time we use a EmbeddedStorageManager as a backing store for the cache. EmbeddedStorageManager storageManager = EmbeddedStorage.start(); CachingProvider provider = Caching.getCachingProvider(); CacheManager cacheManager = provider.getCacheManager(); CacheConfiguration configuration = CacheConfiguration .Builder(Integer.class, String.class, \"jCache\", storageManager) .expiryPolicyFactory(CreatedExpiryPolicy.factoryOf(Duration.ONE_HOUR)) .build(); Cache cache = cacheManager.createCache(\"jCache\", configuration); cache.put(1, \"one\"); String value = cache.get(1);","title":"Getting Started","component":"manual","version":"master","name":"getting-started","url":"/manual/cache/getting-started.html","titles":[{"text":"Prerequisites","hash":"_prerequisites","id":1},{"text":"Hello World","hash":"_hello_world","id":2}]},"93":{"id":93,"text":"EclipseStore provides a JCache (JSR-107) implementation, which is optionally backed by a EclipseStore Storage. JCache standardizes caching for the Java platform. It provides a common mechanism to cache values in a map-like structure. It expedites the mainstream adoption of in-memory computing by giving all Java developers an easy way to access memory from within Java. Businesses can change providers without rewriting their applications or maintaining a proprietary cache abstraction layer. This caching standard is used in a wide variety of environments. The most common use cases are: Second-level cache in JPA (e.g. Hibernate) Spring Cache Abstraction and many more Why another JCache implementation, you may wonder. There is already a myriad of providers out there. EclipseStore’s very own serialization and storage can be utilized to get the best out of caches. For example, you are not limited to java.io.Serializable types, when storing a value. That means every key-value pair gets copied every time you put and get entries in and out of a cache. And if a cache is used with a backing store, EclipseStore’s storage can be used to get the best possible performance. And now, EclipseStore being a JCache provider, you can use it as a drop-in replacement in your existing application. The caching provider represents the implementation of JCache that you are using. You can use more than one JCache implementation in your project if you wish, and CachingProvider is how you access the different providers that are in use. It is responsible for managing and providing access to many named caches. The cache holds the different values being cached. You can have several caches, each of which may be holding data for a different purpose. Each one can have a different configuration; for example, different caches may evict old data using different techniques. Each item of data in a cache is an entry, which is a key-value pair. The key is a unique value used to store and look up the data. The value is the actual data you wish to cache. Caches have some different properties than Maps, but the calls that you would use to store and lookup data is very similar.","title":"Cache","component":"manual","version":"master","name":"index","url":"/manual/cache/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Motivation","hash":"_motivation","id":1},{"text":"Basic Concepts of JCache","hash":"_basic_concepts_of_jcache","id":2},{"text":"CachingProvider","hash":"_cachingprovider","id":3},{"text":"CacheManager","hash":"_cachemanager","id":4},{"text":"Cache","hash":"_cache","id":5},{"text":"Entry","hash":"_entry","id":6}]},"94":{"id":94,"text":"EclipseStore provides a module for simple object based network communication over TCP connections.

If using Maven, just add module communication-binary into your pom.xml dependencies. pom.xml org.eclipse.serializer communication-binary 2.0.0 The Hello World example consists of two applications. The Host and the Client application. The host will open a network port and listen for incoming connections from the client. If a client connects successfully, it awaits data from the client that will be sent back to the client. The basic example won’t do any configuration, so the connection is not secured, and the client and host use the local system address at port 1099. public class EchoServer { public static void main(final String[] args) { final ComHost host = ComBinaryDynamic.Foundation() .setHostChannelAcceptor(channel -> { final Object received = channel.receive(); System.out.println(\"received: \" + received); channel.send(received); }) .createHost(); // run the host, making it constantly listen for new connections and relaying them to the logic host.run(); } } public class EchoClient { public static void main(final String[] args) { //create the client final ComClient client = ComBinaryDynamic.Foundation() .createClient(); //connect to the host and communicate try(final ComChannel channel = client.connect()) { channel.send(\"Hello Host\"); final Object received = channel.receive(); System.out.println(\"received: \" + received); } } } Configuration of host and client is done using the ComFoundation.Default implementation of the ComFoundation interface. To get a preconfigured foundation instance, the classes ComBinaryDynamic and ComBinary provide the convenient method Foundation(). The Object communication of Eclipse Serializer is available in two flavours: Dynamic and non-dynamic. They differ in the way classes that should be serialized and transferred are handled: The non-dynamic version requires all classes that should be transferred to be registered at initialization time. This can be done with the registerEntityType methods of the ComFoundation. If a transferred object graph references any unregistered class, an exception will occur! The dynamic implementation automatically registers all classes that are part of the communication at runtime. It will also do a type-mapping if classes with the same name have different implementations on the client and host. host binding address The host’s IP address is configured with ComFoundation.setHostBindingAddress(InetSocketAddress). client target address The address the client connects to is configured by ComFoundation.setClientTargetAddress(InetSocketAddress). port only If no host or client target address is configured, it is possible to use ComFoundation.setPort(int) to set a port that is used together with the default IP addresses for the host and client. registering entity types to register entity types at startup, use ComFoundation.registerEntityTypes(Class…​) for example.

This API is part of the persistence-binary module: pom.xml org.eclipse.serializer serializer 2.0.0 You can use any medium type, but for most purposes, the byte array version should be sufficient to transfer the serialized form over the transport layer of your choice. Simply create a serializer instance, optionally based on a foundation, and call the serialize and deserialize methods. final SerializerFoundation foundation = SerializerFoundation.New() .registerEntityTypes(Customer.class); final Serializer serializer = Serializer.Bytes(foundation); byte[] data = serializer.serialize(customer); Customer restored = serializer.deserialize(data); The serializer uses the EclipseStore’s type handling system. This includes registration of new types on demand during serialization and legacy type mapping when deserializing. The SerializerFoundation provides an API like the MicroStream storage to configure the type handling behavior. The default Serializer implementation does not include type information in the serialized output! If you want to deserialize that with another serializer instance, you must register all classes using the SerializerFoundation before you create the serializer or use a TypedSerializer! The serializer internally generates a dictionary that describes all serialized types. This dictionary can be exported and imported to exchange those type informations between different serializer instances. The current type information can be obtained as Sting using the serializers exportTypeDictionay() method: final String typeDictionaryString = serializer.exportTypeDictionay(); To import an initial type dictionary, it must be supplied as a String. The SerializerFoundation offers methods to import that type dictionary string before the serializer instance is generated: Using the static New(String typeDictionaryString) Method: final SerializerFoundation foundation = SerializerFoundation.New(typeDictionaryString); Using the setInitialTypeDictionary(String typeDictionaryString) method: final SerializerFoundation foundation = SerializerFoundation.New(); foundation.setInitialTypeDictionary(typeDictionaryString); The TypedSerializer implementation includes type information into the serialized output. By default, the complete set of type information is included in all serialized output. final Serializer serializer = TypedSerializer.Bytes(foundation); byte[] data = serializer.serialize(customer); Customer restored = serializer.deserialize(data); To reduce the serialized data, it is possible to configure the included type information by supplying a SerializerTypeInfoStrategyCreator to the SerializerFoundation. final SerializerFoundation foundation = SerializerFoundation.New() .setSerializerTypeInfoStrategyCreator( new SerializerTypeInfoStrategyCreator.IncrementalDiff(false)); return TypedSerializer.Bytes(foundation); Property Description TypeDictionary Includes type information for all types currently known to the serializer, including those registered during the setup. Diff Includes type information for all types currently known to the serializer, including those registered during the setup. IncrementalDiff Includes only type information for types added to the serializers type registry in the current serialization. Types that are registered during the serializer’s setup are never included.

One value after another as a trivial byte stream. References between objects are mapped with unique numbers, called ObjectId, or short OID. With both combined, byte streams and OIDs, an object graph can be stored in a simple and quick way, as well as loaded, as a whole or partially. But there is a small catch. Where does it start? What is the first instance or reference at startup? Strictly speaking \"nothing\". That’s why at least one instance or a reference to an instance must be registered in a special way, so that the application has a starting point from where the object graph can be loaded. This is a \"Root Instance\". Same difference, another problem are instances which are references by constant fields in Java classes. These aren’t created when the records are loaded from the database, but by the JVM while loading the classes. Without special treatment, this would be a problem: The application, meaning the JVM or the JVM process, starts, the constant instances are created by the JVM, one or more of them are stored, then the application shuts down. The stored data of the constants are now stored with a certain OID in the database. The application starts again. The Constant instances are created again by the JVM. The data records are read by EclipseStore. The problem is: How should the application know what values, which are stored with a certain OID, belong to which constant? The JVM created everything from scratch at startup and doesn’t know anything about OIDs. To resolve this, the constant instances must be registered, just like the entity graph’s root instance. Then EclipseStore can associate the constant instances with the stored data via the OIDs. Constant instances can be thought of as JVM-created implicit root instances for the object graph. In both cases, root and constant instances, it is about registering special starting points for the object graph in order to load it correctly. For EclipseStore, from a plain technical view, both cases don’t make a difference. In the most common cases, nothing at all. The default behavior is enough to get things going. By default, a single instance can be registered as the entity graph’s root, accessible via EmbeddedStorage.root(). Therefore, this is already a fully fledged (although tiny) database application: // Start the database manager EmbeddedStorageManager storageManager = EmbeddedStorage.start(); // Set the entity (graph) as root storageManager.setRoot(\"Hello World\"); // Store root storageManager.storeRoot(); If you are working with EclipseStore technology in a multi-threaded environment, there are a few things you need to pay extra attention to. When using standard frameworks, you often work in a multi-threaded environment. If you are using the older JDBC approach, you create a copy of your data that you work with within a single thread, modify the data, and then save it back in a database trace. EclipseStore works with data directly, allowing it to achieve significantly better performance parameters. However, for developers, this means that any reading and writing to this shared object graph must be synchronized. To make it easier to use within your application, we have prepared a simple way for you to do so. XThreads.executeSynchronized(() -> { root.changeData(); storageManager.store(root); }); This approach will immediately provide you with several benefits: Any changes to your object graph will be synchronized, every other thread will see the current value. Avoid Deadlocks In principle, you prevent the object graph from being modified at the same time it is saved. The simple default approach has its limits when the application defines an explicit root instance that must be updated/filled from the database directly during database initialization. Something like this: // Empty application-specific root, to be filled during start() MyApplicationRoot root = new MyApplicationRoot(); // Start the database manager EmbeddedStorageManager storage = EmbeddedStorage.start(); // root must be filled at this point... but how? root.printAllMyEntities(); To solve this, a custom root instance can be directly registered at the database setup. In the simplest case, is just has to be passed to .start();: // Empty application-specific root, to be filled during start() MyApplicationRoot root = new MyApplicationRoot(); // Start the database manager with a reference to the application's root. EmbeddedStorageManager storageManager = EmbeddedStorage.start(root); // root is \"magically\" filled at this point. (Yay!) root.printAllMyEntities(); Internally, the two concepts (default root and custom root) and handled by different mechanisms. This can be seen from the two different methods storageManager.defaultRoot(); storageManager.customRoot(); The simplified method storageManager.root(); automatically chooses the variant that is used. Since neither of those three methods can know the concrete type of the root instance (and adding a type parameter just for that would have been a complication overkill), they all can only be typed to return Object. So, to avoid annoying and dangerous casts, it is best to keep a direct reference to a custom root instance as shown in the code snippet above. Likewise, storageManager.storeRoot(); works for both variants, so there is no need to worry about how to store which one.","title":"Root Instances","component":"manual","version":"master","name":"root-instances","url":"/manual/storage/root-instances.html","titles":[{"text":"What Must Be Done in the Application?","hash":"_what_must_be_done_in_the_application","id":1},{"text":"Shared Mutable Data","hash":"_shared_mutable_data","id":2},{"text":"Synchronize access to shared mutable data","hash":"_synchronize_access_to_shared_mutable_data","id":3},{"text":"Custom Root Instances","hash":"_custom_root_instances","id":4}]},"100":{"id":100,"text":"The default way to configure a JCache provider is to use the class javax.cache.configuration.MutableConfiguration.

An example makes this clear. Suppose we have defined a cache where the ExpiryPolicy is set to 1 Minute. When we create an entry in this cache and we did not request the cache entry after the 1-minute expiry before we do shut down the application. When we start up the application again, When we request the cache entry, it is loaded from the EclipseStore Storage Manager and 'created' with a new expiry of 1 minute. This means that even if the entry was already created more than 1 minute ago (even when we only take into consideration the application uptime), the entry is still returned to the calling code. application.properties spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.cache.eclipsestore.missing_cache_strategy = create spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.cache.eclipsestore.readThrough = true spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.cache.eclipsestore.writeThrough = true spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.cache.eclipsestore.storage.baseDirectory = ~/cache-data spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.cache.eclipsestore.storage.channelCount = 4 spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.cache.region.factory_class = org.eclipse.store.cache.hibernate.types.CacheRegionFactory spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.cache.use_query_cache = true spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.cache.use_second_level_cache = true application.yml spring: jpa: properties: hibernate: cache: eclipsestore: missing_cache_strategy: create readThrough: true writeThrough: true storage: baseDirectory: ~/cache-data channelCount: 4 region: factory_class: org.eclipse.store.cache.hibernate.types.CacheRegionFactory use_query_cache: true use_second_level_cache: true","title":"Storage","component":"manual","version":"master","name":"storage","url":"/manual/cache/configuration/storage.html","titles":[{"text":"Cache expiry and StorageManager","hash":"_cache_expiry_and_storagemanager","id":1},{"text":"Spring example","hash":"_spring_example","id":2}]},"103":{"id":103,"text":"EclipseStore offers a Hibernate cache region factory, which can be found in the cache.hibernate module. pom.xml org.eclipse.store cache-hibernate 2.0.0 The region factory’s class name is org.eclipse.store.cache.hibernate.types.CacheRegionFactory.

It is available within this artifact: pom.xml org.eclipse.store eclipse-store-integrations-cdi4 2.0.0 The integration requires the javax namespace and requires a CDI 4.0 implementation and an Eclipse MicroProfile Config 2.0 implementation. This CDI extension makes use of the Extension interface and the BeanManager functionality, so it might not work in a strict Jakarta EE 10 Core Profile product that only supports the CDI Lite functionality. The configuration of the StorageManager can be done using key/value pairs that are provided by MicroProfile Config. The configuration keys must be prefixed by org.eclipse.store org.eclipse.store.storage-directory=/opt/data/eclipsestore org.eclipse.store.channel-count=2 Since the - character is not supported in some sources (like the environment variables), you can also define the configuration keys using the . character. org.eclipse.store.storage.directory=/opt/data/eclipsestore org.eclipse.store.channel.count=2 Besides that, the regular MicroProfile Config rules about keys are applied (since we are using MicroProfile Config directly, see specification). The configured and started StorageManager is a CDI bean and thus can be injected or retrieved programmatically. @Inject private StorageManager storageManager; public void someMethod() { StorageManager storageManager = CDI.current().select(StorageManager.class).get(); } The StorageManager configuration can be customized by CDI beans that implement the interface org.eclipse.store.integrations.cdi.types.config.EmbeddedStorageFoundationCustomizer. The customize method is called with an EmbeddedStorageFoundation which allows you to fully customize the StorageManager that will be created. You can for example, add the specific Type Handlers for JDK 8 as described on the documentation. After the StorageManager is created, the CDI beans that implement org.eclipse.store.integrations.cdi.types.config.StorageManagerInitializer are called. You have the opportunity to perform actions on the StorageManager or root object. Following rules apply to the StorageManager that is passed to the initialize method of the interface. The StorageManager is already started unless you specified the configuration value org.eclipse.store.autoStart=false. If you have used the @Storage annotation on a class, the StorageManager is already associated with an instance of that class as the Root object. There is a second option to configure and retrieve the StorageManager, and it makes use of the EclipseStore functionality to read the configuration from any file. @Inject @ConfigProperty(name = \"org.eclipse.store.ini\") private StorageManager storageManager; The above construct makes use of the MicroProfile Config functionality that you convert the value of the key org.eclipse.store.ini and convert it into a StorageManager. The value of the key is expected to point to an existing file. The formats XML, INI, and properties are supported. The StorageManager is also fully configured and started just as you would use it when using the first option of configuration. If you define it multiple times, within different beans, for example, you always receive the same instance of the StorageManager when you specify the same value for the name member of the @ConfigProperty annotation. This way, you can define and use multiple _StorageManager_s within your application. The customizer and initializer features described earlier as CDI beans implementing a specific interface are also available when you use the MicroProfile Config annotation (@ConfigProperty). Since you can define multiple StorageManager_s this way, you can distinguish between them based on the _database name. The database name can be set by using the following property within the configuration file (example makes use of the properties format, but it is also supported in the other formats) database-name=theName If this property is not specified, the value of the MicroProfile config key (used within the name member of @ConfigProperty) is used. Within the customizer and initializer, you can use this to perform the required actions based on the instance you receive. EmbeddedStorageFoundation.getDataBaseName(); StorageManager.databaseName(); The root object can be indicated by using the @Storage annotation on the class. This annotation converts the POJO into a CDI bean (there is no need to use any scope-defining annotation) with Application Scope. This is only supported when you inject the StorageManager without making use of the MicroProfile Config @ConfigProperty annotation. Besides converting it into a CDI bean, any field injection within this class is also resolved. The integration also defines the instance of the class that is created as the root object (StorageManager.setRoot()) and stores the initial value (StorageManager.storeRoot()) when storageManager does not have a root object assigned yet (this happens only the very first time when you start up your application and the storage doesn’t contain any data yet) The POJO must have a (default) no-argument constructor so that the integration can create an instance of it. You can only annotate 1 class with the @Storage annotation, if you have marked multiple, the deployment of your application will fail at the CDI validation phase.","title":"CDI Extension","component":"manual","version":"master","name":"cdi","url":"/manual/misc/integrations/cdi.html","titles":[{"text":"Configuration","hash":"_configuration","id":1},{"text":"Root object","hash":"_root_object","id":2}]},"106":{"id":106,"text":"Various EclipseStore integrations are currently available.

The configuration of the StorageManager can be done using key/value pairs that are provided by Spring Boot external Configuration. The configuration keys must be prefixed by org.eclipse.store org.eclipse.store.storage-directory=/opt/data/eclipse-store-storage org.eclipse.store.channel-count=2 The list of all EclipseStore configuration properties and their meaning are listed on our documentation page. The configuration values are handled using the typesafe configuration approach, and you can read these values by accessing the EclipseStoreProperties Spring bean. The Spring Boot integration provides a set of Bean Factories which read the configuration and initialize the relevant EclipseStore facilities for you, including EmbeddedStorageManager. The simplest way to use this integration is when you can externalize all the configuration using Spring configuration files. Subsequently, you just create a Spring Boot application and add a dependency on the integration. Then, in the Bean where you need access to the StorageManager, you add the @Autowired annotation and a StorageManager is created for you. All configuration values are loaded from the external configuration and the StorageManager is already initialized and ready to use. @SpringBootApplication public class SomeSpringApplication { public static void main(String... args) { SpringApplication.run(SomeSpringApplication.class, args); } } @Component public class JokesStorageImpl implements JokesStorage { private final EmbeddedStorageManager storageManager; // Inject the StorageManager (Constructor injection) public JokesStorageImpl(EmbeddedStorageManager storageManager) { this.storageManager = storageManager; } // Implement the JokesStorage interface } In case you need to modify the configuration in some way in the program, change something, add and the like, you can have the EclipseStoreProperties Spring bean injected into your class. This class contains all the configuration values that are used to create a StorageManager. You can modify these values and then use the EmbeddedStorageManagerFactory Bean to create a new EmbeddedStorageManager or EmbeddedStorageFoundationFactory to create a new EmbeddedStorageFoundation. @Bean EmbeddedStorageManager injectStorageTest( @Autowired EclipseStoreProperties myConfiguration, @Autowired EmbeddedStorageManagerFactory managerFactory, @Autowired EmbeddedStorageFoundationFactory foundationFactory ) { // Modify the configuration myConfiguration.setStorageDirectory(temp.getDir().getAbsolutePath()); // Create a new StorageFoundation EmbeddedStorageFoundation storageFoundation = foundationFactory.createStorageFoundation(myConfiguration); // Modify the storageFoundation //storageFoundation.onConnectionFoundation(f -> f.someOperation); // Create a new StorageManager return managerFactory.createEmbeddedStorageManager(storageFoundation, true); } The StorageManager is already started unless you specified the configuration value org.eclipse.store.auto-start=false. If you have used the org.eclipse.store.root configuration item, the StorageManager is already associated with an instance of that class as the Root object. This class must have a default or public no-argument constructor. It is also possible to obtain the entire configuration within the StorageManagerConfiguration Bean, enabling you to directly create a foundation and storage manager. This can be helpful if you need to stop storage at runtime and then restart it. If the user does not define any beans of type EmbeddedStorageFoundation and EmbeddedStorageManager, these beans are automatically created. This behavior can be changed using the following configuration. org.eclipse.store.auto-create-default-storage=false org.eclipse.store.auto-create-default-foundation=false You can have a more than one Storage Manager in your application. This can be useful if you want to have different storage targets for different data. For example, you might want to have a datastore for your user data and another for your product data. You can do this by creating multiple configuration classes and multiple Storage Managers. @Configuration public class TwoBeanConfiguration { @Autowired private EmbeddedStorageFoundationFactory foundationFactory; @Autowired private EmbeddedStorageManagerFactory managerFactory; @Bean(\"first_config\") @ConfigurationProperties(\"org.eclipse.store.first\") EclipseStoreProperties firstStoreProperties() { return new EclipseStoreProperties(); } @Bean(\"second_config\") @ConfigurationProperties(\"org.eclipse.store.second\") EclipseStoreProperties secondStoreProperties() { return new EclipseStoreProperties(); } @Bean @Qualifier(\"first_storage\") EmbeddedStorageManager createFirstStorage(@Qualifier(\"first_config\") final EclipseStoreProperties firstStoreProperties) { return managerFactory.createStorage( foundationFactory.createStorageFoundation(firstStoreProperties), firstStoreProperties.isAutoStart() ); } @Bean @Qualifier(\"second_storage\") EmbeddedStorageManager createSecondStorage(@Qualifier(\"second_config\") final EclipseStoreProperties secondStoreProperties) { return managerFactory.createStorage( foundationFactory.createStorageFoundation(secondStoreProperties), secondStoreProperties.isAutoStart() ); } } The configuration properties are defined in the application.properties file with appropriate prefixes. org.eclipse.store.first.storage-directory=${java.io.tmpdir}/${random.int} org.eclipse.store.first.auto-start=false org.eclipse.store.first.root=org.eclipse.store.integrations.spring.boot.types.storages.FirstRoot org.eclipse.store.second.storage-directory=${java.io.tmpdir}/${random.int} org.eclipse.store.second.auto-start=false org.eclipse.store.second.root=org.eclipse.store.integrations.spring.boot.types.storages.SecondRoot EclipseStore supports mutex locking. This is useful if you have multiple processes that need to access the same objects. Easiest way to use it is to use the annotation @read and @write on the methods that need to be locked. The annotation @read is used for methods that only read data and @write is used for methods that modify data. To activate mutex locking, you need to add the following dependency to Maven pom.xml of your SpringBoot application: pom.xml org.springframework.boot spring-boot-starter-aop Then you can use the Mutex Locking in your code: @Component public class SomeStorageImpl implements SomeStorage { @Read public String getSomethingById(Integer Id) { // Read something from the storage } @Write public void addSomething(String something) { // Add something to the storage } } If you have larger object graph, you can consider to add more Mutexes and lock different parts of the object graph. This can be done by adding the @Mutex annotation to the class. The parameter of this annotation is the name of the mutex. If you have multiple classes with the same mutex name, they will be locked together. @Component @Mutex(\"jokes\") public class JokesStorageImpl implements JokesStorage { } EclipseStore Spring module supports standard Spring logging, so you can add this into your config: logging.level.org.eclipse.store=debug to obtain all EclipseStore configuration keys: 15:57:34.923 [main] DEBUG o.e.s.i.s.b.t.EclipseStoreProviderImpl -- EclipseStore configuration items: 15:57:34.923 [main] DEBUG o.e.s.i.s.b.t.EclipseStoreProviderImpl -- storage-directory : jokes_storage 15:57:34.923 [main] DEBUG o.e.s.i.s.b.t.EclipseStoreProviderImpl -- channel-count : 2 15:57:34.923 [main] DEBUG o.e.s.i.s.b.t.EclipseStoreProviderImpl -- auto-start : true Key values containing \"password\" are replaced by \"xxxxx\". Handler for JDK 17 are registered automatically. Handler for JDK 8 are not registered automatically, because of the backwards compatibility. If you create a new storage you can enable these handlers. If you have an existing storage created with JDK8 handlers, you have to active it too. If you need to register JDK 8 handlers, you can do it by adding the following code to your configuration: org.eclipse.store.register-jdk8-handlers=true If you are interested in using the EclipseStore REST service in your application, consider to include the SpringBoot REST Service. Detailed documentation can be found at Setup of Spring Boot REST Service. You can include the Client GUI application to be directly as a module served by your application. For this purpose, include the SpringBoot Console to your application classpath. We assume that you are starting Spring MVC in your application already. Please add the following dependency to Maven pom.xml of your SpringBoot application: org.eclipse.store integrations-spring-boot3-console {maven-version} In order to operate properly, Client GUI requires a working SpringBoot REST Service. This is already prepackaged in the console module and needs to be activated. In addition, the path to the Client GUI needs to be configured. Please set the following properties in your configuration file: org.eclipse.store.rest.enabled=true vaadin.url-mapping=/store-console/* The Client GUI will start with your application and will be available at the specified URL. So if your SpringBoot application starts a web server on port 8080 the Client GUI will be available at: http://localhost:8080/store-console/. Open this URL in your browser, select from the dropdown list the endpoint of the Spring REST Service (http://localhost:8080/store-data/) and click connect. If you are using Spring Dev Tools, it is recommended to exclude the EclipseStore classes from the classpath. Spring Dev Tools use their own restart classloader, which dynamically reloads classes. This can cause issues with the EclipseStore classes, as they are not designed to be reloaded on the fly.

So you can control versioning for multiple entities at once, or even for the hole entity graph. Do not share auto-incrementing contexts! Use a mutable context instead. The auto-incrementing contexts take care of the key creation. If you need to control it by yourself, use the mutable context.

All types in the public API are, whenever possible, interfaces. This offers the best possibilities to extend or exchange parts of the engine. A good ways to enrich a type with features, is the wrapper (decorator) pattern. For example, let’s say we want to add logging to the PersistenceStoring's store(object) method. PersistenceStoring.java public interface PersistenceStoring { public long store(Object instance); public long[] storeAll(Object... instances); public void storeAll(Iterable instances); public void storeSelfStoring(SelfStoring storing); } Conventionally it would be done that way: A new type, implementing the original interface, would be handed over the wrapped instance, all interface methods have to be implemented and delegated. And in the single method, we wanted to add functionality; the actual implementation of the logging is done. public class PersistenceStoringWithLogging implements PersistenceStoring { private final PersistenceStoring wrapped; public PersistenceStoringWithLogging(final PersistenceStoring wrapped) { super(); this.wrapped = wrapped; } @Override public long store(final Object instance) { Logger.getLogger(PersistenceStoring.class.getName()) .info(\"Object stored: \" + instance); return this.wrapped.store(instance); } @Override public long[] storeAll(final Object... instances) { return this.wrapped.storeAll(instances); } @Override public void storeAll(final Iterable instances) { this.wrapped.storeAll(instances); } @Override public void storeSelfStoring(final SelfStoring storing) { this.wrapped.storeSelfStoring(storing); } } This produces a lot of overhead. In this case, three methods are just boilerplate code to delegate the calls to the wrapped instance. A common solution for that is to create an abstract base wrapper type for the designated interface, and to reuse it whenever needed. public abstract class BaseWrapperPersistenceStoring implements PersistenceStoring { private final PersistenceStoring wrapped; public BaseWrapperPersistenceStoring(final PersistenceStoring wrapped) { super(); this.wrapped = wrapped; } @Override public long store(final Object instance) { return this.wrapped.store(instance); } @Override public long[] storeAll(final Object... instances) { return this.wrapped.storeAll(instances); } @Override public void storeAll(final Iterable instances) { this.wrapped.storeAll(instances); } @Override public void storeSelfStoring(final SelfStoring storing) { this.wrapped.storeSelfStoring(storing); } } And then, based on that, the implementation of the logger type would look like this: public class PersistenceStoringWithLogging extends BaseWrapperPersistenceStoring { public PersistenceStoringWithLogging(PersistenceStoring wrapped) { super(wrapped); } @Override public long store(Object instance) { Logger.getLogger(PersistenceStoring.class.getName()) .info(\"Object stored: \" + instance); return super.store(instance); } } That’s better. No more boilerplate code. Just overwrite the methods you want to extend. The only work left is, to generate the base wrapper types. One way is to let your IDE generate the wrapper or delegation code. Disadvantage of that is, it has to be redone every time your interfaces change. A code generator, which does it automatically would be nice. And that’s what the base module brings along.

This offers you the most flexible way to use it in your application. The Wrapper type is just a typed interface and an abstract implementation of itself. Wrapper.java public interface Wrapper { public W wrapped(); public abstract class Abstract implements Wrapper { private final W wrapped; protected Abstract(final W wrapped) { super(); this.wrapped = wrapped; } @Override public final W wrapped() { return this.wrapped; } } } You can either implement the Wrapper interface and provide the wrapped instance via the wrapped() method, or you can extend the abstract class and hand over the wrapped instance to the super constructor.

Time for the house keeping interval. House keeping tasks are, among others: Garbage Collection Cache Check File Cleanup Check In combination with housekeeping-time-budget, it can be specified how many CPU time should be used for house keeping. E.g. interval=1000ms and budget=10000000ns means every second there’s 0.01 seconds time for house keeping, so max 1% CPU time used for house keeping. This CPU time window is only used if house keeping work is pending. If nothing has to be done, no time is wasted. Time used for each housekeeping cycle. However, no matter how low the number is, one item of work will always be completed. But if there is nothing to clean up, no processor time will be wasted. Default is 10000000 (10 million nanoseconds = 10 milliseconds = 0.01 seconds). However, no matter how small the time is, one item is done at least. This is to avoid no-ops, if a too small time window is configured. This time budget is a \"best effort\" threshold, meaning when at 1ns left, a huge file has to be cleaned or the references of a huge collection have to be marked for GC, then this budget can be exceeded considerably. For further information see Housekeeping. Minimum file size in bytes of a storage file to avoid merging with other files during housekeeping. Must be greater than 1, maximum is 2GB. Maximum file size in bytes of a storage file to avoid splitting in more files during housekeeping. Must be greater than 1, maximum is 2GB. Due to internal implementation details files larger than 2GB are not supported! The ratio (value in ]0.0;1.0]) of non-gap data contained in a storage file to prevent the file from being dissolved. \"Gap\" data is anything that is not the latest version of an entity’s data, including older versions of an entity and \"comment\" bytes (a sequence of bytes beginning with its length as a negative value length header). The closer this value is to 1.0 (100%), the less disk space is occupied by storage files, but the more file dissolving (data transfers to new files) is required and vice versa. Maximum file size for each channels transactions log file. If this limit is exceeded the file wile be cleaned up during housekeeping.

Since there is a limitation in EclipseStore that you can have only one manager that is connected to one data storage, you can bypass this restriction with this read-only mode. But there are limitations, such as: In read-only mode, you cannot write to a data storage. This means calls to .store() and other methods resulting in a write will throw an exception. In read-only mode, the housekeeping processes do not run since that would corrupt the data storage because two managers operate on the same 'files'. In read-only mode, your data root is filled on startup of the manager as usual, and lazy references operate as normal. However, there is no notification mechanism that the underlying data storage has changed, and the Storage Manager only remembers the structure of the data storage as it was when it started. The last bullet point is important. It indicates that when another Storage Manager writes some new data, this new data never gets picked up by this read-only manager. When the other Storage Manager housekeeping process removes a file or reorganizes a file as cleanup, an exception will be thrown as the structure is changed but still expected by the read-only manager. So, the read-only manager can only be used to read some data but should be closed 'soon' after starting, and a new manager should be created if you need to read data later on.

It actually wraps the StorageWriteController configured by the Foundation and can either block or pass through the normal behaviour.

This renders the application and the database incompatible. It’s like in an IDE. You change the structure of a class and the tooling takes care of the rest. Problem is, in a database, the \"rest\" can be, in some circumstances, several gigabytes or even more, that have to be refactored and written again. It’s one way to do it, but there are better alternatives. At best, the data is transformed when it’s accessed only. The old (legacy) type data is being mapped to the new type when it’s being loaded, hence: Legacy Type Mapping. Nothing needs to be rewritten. All records are, as they were saved, compatible with all other versions of their type. Simply by mapping while loading. What has to be done to achieve this? In the most common cases, nothing! The heuristic attempts to automatically detect which fields are new, have been removed, reordered or altered. Contact.java (old) public class Contact { String name ; String firstname; int age ; String email ; String note ; Object link ; } Contact.java (new) public class Contact { String firstname ; // moved String lastname ; // renamed String emailAddress ; // renamed String supportNode ; // renamed PostalAddress postalAddress; // new int age ; // moved } Console Output ---------- Legacy type mapping required for legacy type 1000055:Contact to current type 1000056:Contact Fields: java.lang.String Contact#firstname -1.000 ----> java.lang.String Contact#firstname java.lang.String Contact#name -0.750 ----> java.lang.String Contact#lastname java.lang.String Contact#email -0.708 ----> java.lang.String Contact#emailAddress java.lang.String Contact#note -0.636 ----> java.lang.String Contact#supportNode [***new***] PostalAddress Contact#postalAddress int Contact#age -1.000 ----> int Contact#age java.lang.Object Contact#link [discarded] --- Write 'y' to accept the mapping. The fields in the Contact entity class have been renamed, reordered, one was removed, one is new. What the heuristic is doing now is something like this: String firstname is equal in both classes, so it has to be the same, pretty much as int age. name and lastname is pretty similar, type is the same too. If there is nothing better for the two, they probably belong together. Same with the other two fields. In the end, the ominous link and postalAddress remain. The heuristic can not make sense of that, so it assumes that one thing falls away and the other one is added. In this particular example, that worked perfectly. Well done, heuristic. But: Just as people can make mistakes in estimating similarities (\"I would have thought …​\"), even programs can make mistakes as soon as they logically go on thin ice. There is nothing more with absolute correctness that you actually know from (bug-free) software. Such a similarity matching will be correct in the most cases, but sometimes it will also fall by the wayside. Example: perhaps only PostalAddress instances were referenced in the application under link and the two fields would actually be the same, only now properly typed and named. How should heuristics know that? Nobody could know that either, if he is not privy to the details of the concrete application. That’s why Legacy Type Mapping has two mechanisms that prevent things from going wrong: A callback interface is used to create the desired mapping result: PersistenceLegacyTypeMappingResultor Optionally, an explicit mapping can be specified, which is then preferred to the heuristic approach. If you do not want that, you can simply set another resultor. Like in this example each suspected mapping is submitted once to the user for control in the console. This is done with the InquiringLegacyTypeMappingResultor. Maybe even one, where the user can \"rewire\" the mapping itself, write out the mapping, and then return an appropriate result. EmbeddedStorageFoundation foundation = EmbeddedStorage.Foundation(myDataDir); foundation.getConnectionFoundation().setLegacyTypeMappingResultor( InquiringLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New( PersistenceLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New() ) ); EmbeddedStorageManager storageManager = foundation.createEmbeddedStorageManager(myRoot).start(); All you need is two columns of strings: from old to new. By default EclipseStore uses a CSV file, but you can also write something else. In the end, a lot of string pairs for \"old → new\" mappings have to come into the program somewhere. The concept is simple: If there are two strings, this is interpreted as a mapping from an old thing to a new thing. If the second value is missing, it is interpreted as an old thing to be deleted. Missing the first value, then it’s as a new thing. Why call it \"thing\"? Because this applies to several structural elements: Constant identifier Class names Field names Example: count; articleCount means: the field named earlier count is called articleCount in the current version of the class. count; means: the early field count should be ignored during the mapping. More specifically, the values ​​of this field per record. ;articleCount means, this is a newly added field, DO NOT try to match it with anything else heuristically. You can also mix explicit mapping and heuristics. Only explicitly specify so many changes until the analysis gets the rest right by itself. That means you never have to specify the annoying trivial cases explicitly. Only the tricky ones. Usually, nothing should be necessary at all, or maybe a view indications at most to avoid mishaps. However, those who strictly prefer to make any change explicitly, instead of trusting a \"guessing\" software, can also do that. No problem. For class names, the three variants map, add and remove are somewhat tricky in meaning: Map is just old → new, same as with fields. To make an entry for a new class doesn’t make sense. It’s covered by the new class itself. You can do it, but it has no effect. Marking a removed class as deleted makes no sense either, except one special case. It is not required to specify the fields mapping of mapped classes if the mapping heuristic can do a correct field mapping. Especially if classes have been renamed only. Classes are simply referred to by their full qualified class name: com.my.app.entities.Order In some cases you need to specify the exact Version of the class, then the TypeId has to be prepended: 1012345:com.my.app.entities.Order Mapping from old to new: com.my.app.entities.Order;com.my.app.entities.OrderImplementation For fields it’s a bit more complex. To unambiguously refer a field, the full qualified name of its defining class has to be used. com.my.app.entities.Order#count;com.my.app.entities.Order#articleCount The # is based on official Java syntax, like e.g. in JavaDoc. If inheritance is involved, which must be uniquely resolved (each class in the hierarchy can have a field named \"count\"), you must also specify the declaring class. Like this: com.my.app.entities.Order#com.my.app.entities.ArticleHolder#count; ⤦ com.my.App.entities.Order#com.my.app.entities.ArticleHolder#articleCount A simple example: OldContact.java package com.my.app.entities; public class OldContact { String name ; String firstname; int age ; String email ; String note ; Object link ; // to be discarded } NewContact.java package com.my.app.entities; public class NewContact { String firstname ; // moved String lastname ; // renamed String emailAddress ; // renamed String supportNote ; // renamed PostalAddress postalAddress; // new int age ; // moved } refactorings.csv old current com.my.app.entities.OldContact com.my.app.entities.NewContact com.my.app.entities.OldContact#firstname com.my.app.entities.NewContact#firstname com.my.app.entities.OldContact#name com.my.app.entities.NewContact#lastname com.my.app.entities.OldContact#email com.my.app.entities.NewContact#emailAddress com.my.app.entities.OldContact#note com.my.app.entities.NewContact#supportNote com.my.app.entities.NewContact#postalAddress com.my.app.entities.OldContact#age com.my.app.entities.NewContact#age com.my.app.entities.OldContact#link EmbeddedStorageFoundation foundation = EmbeddedStorage.Foundation(dataDir); foundation.setRefactoringMappingProvider( Persistence.RefactoringMapping(Paths.get(\"refactorings.csv\")) ); EmbeddedStorageManager storageManager = foundation.createEmbeddedStorageManager(root).start(); So far so good, all classes and fields are getting mapped, automatically or manually. But what about the data? How are the values getting transformed from old to new? Technically speaking it’s done fully automatic. But there are some interesting questions: What if the primitive types changes? What if primitives change to references and vice versa? How fast is it? Let’s say int to float. Just to copy the four bytes would yield wrong results. It has to be converted, like float floatValue = (float)intValue; Can it be done? Yes, fully automatic. The class BinaryValueTranslators does the job for you, it has a converter function from each primitive to another. Currently EclipseStore supports conversion between primitives and their wrapper types, and vice versa. When converting a wrapper to a primitive, null is converted to 0. If you need special conversions between object types, you can add custom BinaryValueSetter for that, see customizing. How fast is that? The type analysis happens only once during initialization. If no exception occurs, the Legacy Type Mapping is ready-configured for each necessary type and will then only be called if required. For normal entity classes that are parsed by reflection, legacy type mapping loading is just as fast as a normal load. An array of such value translator functions is put together once and they are run through each time they are loaded. With legacy mapping, only the order and the target offsets are different, but the principle is the same as with normal loading. For custom handlers an intermediate step is necessary: ​​First put all the old values ​​together in an order that the custom handler expects and then read the binary data normally, as if loading a record in the current format. That’s necessary because EclipseStore can’t know what such a custom handler does internally. If someone ever uses such a custom handler, the small detour is not likely to be noticeable in terms of performance. And if it should be the case and it has a negative effect on the productive operation: No problem, because: Of course you can also write a custom legacy type handler. It would run at full speed even with tricky special cases. Of course there is the possibility, as always, of intervening in the machinery massively with customizing. If you need the highest possible performance for some cases, or for logging / debugging, or anyway: Register any value translator implementations. In the simplest case this is 1 line of code, so do not worry. Being able to specify refactoring mapping in a different way than a CSV file is another example. You can even customize (extend or replace) the strategy that is looked up in refactoring mapping. Furthermore, you can also replace the heuristic logic with your own. This is easier than it sounds. This is just a primitive little interface (PersistenceMemberSimilator) and the default implementation thereof calls e.g. just a Levenshtein algorithm for names. You can certainly do that 10 times more clever. Or \"more appropriate\" for a particular application or programming style. E.g. utilize annotations. The basic statement is: If there is a problem somewhere, whether with the heuristic or a special case request or performance problem loading a gazillion entities all at once, or if there is a need for debugging in depth or something like that: do not panic. Most likely, this is easily possible with a few lines of code. Customizing examples You can not just mark classes as deleted. As long as there are records of a certain type in the database, the corresponding class must also exist so that the instances from the database can be loaded into the application. If there are no more records, then that means that there are only a few bytes of orphaned description in the type dictionary, but nobody cares. Is it possible to delete it by hand (or rather not, there are good reasons against it) or you can just ignore it and leave it there forever. In both cases, you must not mark a class as deleted. Now the special case: In the entity graph (root instances and all recursively reachable instances from there) all references to instances of a certain type are filled in. It’s done by the application logic or possibly by a specially written script. That is, all instances of this type are unreachable. No instance is available, no instance can ever be reloaded. This means that the type is \"deleted\" from the database at the logical level. One does not have to register anywhere, that is implicitly just like that. You can actually delete the corresponding Java class from the application project because it will never be needed again during the loading process at runtime. So far so good. There is only one problem: even if the instances are never logically accessible again: the data records are still around in the database files. The initialization scans over all database files, registers all entities, collects all occurring TypeIds and ensures for every TypeId that there is a TypeHandler for it. If necessary, a LegacyTypeHandler with mapping, but still: there must be a TypeHandler for each TypeId. And a TypeHandler needs a runtime type. That is, ass-backwards, over records that are logically already deleted, but only physically still lying around, now it is again enforced that the erasable entity class must be present. Bummer. One can prevent this: there is a \"cleanup\" function in the database management logic, which cleans up all logical gaps in the database files (actually copies all non-gaps into a new file and thus deletes the old file altogether). You would have to call it, then all physical occurrences of the unreachable records disappear and you could easily delete the associated class. But that is annoying. That is why it makes sense for these cases - and only for them - to do the following: If you as a developer are absolutely sure that no single instance of a given class is ever reachable again, i.e. must be loaded, then you can mark a type as \"deleted\" (rather \"unreachable\") in the refactoring mapping. Then the Type Handling will create a dummy TypeHandler that does not need a runtime class. See PersistenceUnreachableTypeHandler. But be careful: if you are mistaken and an instance of such a type is still referenced somewhere and eventually loaded later at runtime, then the Unreachable handler will throw an exception. At some point during the runtime of the application, not even during initialization. The cleanup provides real security: remove all logical gaps and if then with a deleted class no more error in the initialization occurs, it is really superfluous. Any ideas, such as simply returning null in the dummy type handler instead of an instance, are a fire hazard: it may dissolve some annoying situations pleasantly, but it would also mean that existing datasets, potentially entire subgraphs, become hidden from the application. Nevertheless, the database would continue to drag them along, perhaps becoming inexplicably large, and any search for the reason would yield nothing, because the dummy type handler keeps the data records secret. Shortsighted great, but catastrophic in the long run. That’s not good. The only clean solution is: you have to know what to do with your data model. As long as there are still available instances, they must also be loadable. The annoying special case above can be defused without side effects. But it can not be more than that, otherwise it will get rid of the chaos, problems and lost confidence in the correctness of the database solution.","title":"Legacy Type Mapping","component":"manual","version":"master","name":"index","url":"/manual/storage/legacy-type-mapping/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Automatic Mapping","hash":"_automatic_mapping","id":1},{"text":"Explicit Mapping","hash":"explicit-mapping","id":2},{"text":"Explicit Mapping of Classes","hash":"_explicit_mapping_of_classes","id":3},{"text":"Explicit Mapping Syntax","hash":"_explicit_mapping_syntax","id":4},{"text":"Value Conversion","hash":"_value_conversion","id":5},{"text":"Value Conversion of Primitives","hash":"value-conversion-of-primitives","id":6},{"text":"Value Conversion of References / Objects","hash":"value-conversion-of-references","id":7},{"text":"Performance","hash":"performance","id":8},{"text":"Customizing","hash":"customizing","id":9},{"text":"Special Case: Deleted Class","hash":"special-case-deleted-class","id":10}]},"131":{"id":131,"text":"Based on the REST API we provide a client, which serves a convenient web user interface to browse through the storage data.

If your application starts a web server on port 8080, and you haven’t changed the default configuration, the complete base URL will be http://localhost:8080/store-data/. Open it a browser to see further available URLs provided by the REST service. The REST controller is able to provide information about multiple Storage managers of your system. For a storage manager called some its details are available via /storage-data/some. If you haven’t changed the storage manager configuration and use the default one provided by the SpringBoot integration, it will be available via /storage-data/default. You might want to change the base URL of your service. This is possible using the configuration file of your SpringBoot application. The corresponding property is org.eclipse.store.rest.base-url. The example below changes the base URL to /some/other/location: application.properties org.eclipse.store.rest.base-url=/some/other/location In this example, we will use the Spark implementation that EclipseStore provides. This has no dependencies to other frameworks and makes no assumptions about your runtime environment, IoC container, dependency injection, web server or anything else. Just add the dependency to your project, the logger is optional. pom.xml org.eclipse.store storage-restservice-sparkjava 2.0.0 org.slf4j slf4j-simple 1.7.32 Now use the resolver to connect the REST service to the storage, start it, and you’re good to go.

The base URL of the provided endpoints is per default: http://localhost:4567/store-data/ and you can find out all available endpoints on the root http://localhost:4567 If you want to change the default port (4567) or instance name (store-data) it can be done by using the rest service implementation directly, and not go through the _Resolver` as in the previous snippet. The Spark service can then be customized to your liking. StorageRestServiceSparkJava service = StorageRestServiceSparkJava.New(storage); service.setSparkService( Service.ignite().port(8888) ); service.setInstanceName(\"my-name\"); This will change the base URL to http://localhost:8888/my-name/","title":"Setup","component":"manual","version":"master","name":"setup","url":"/manual/storage/rest-interface/setup.html","titles":[{"text":"Spring Boot REST Service","hash":"_spring_boot_rest_service","id":1},{"text":"Additional Configuration","hash":"_additional_configuration","id":2},{"text":"Spark Java REST Service","hash":"_spark_java_rest_service","id":3},{"text":"Additional Configuration","hash":"_additional_configuration_2","id":4}]},"135":{"id":135,"text":"EclipseStore supports a variety of storage targets.

The developer doesn’t have to worry about data synchronization and then store this data in a database transaction. This way of working is very practical, it does not require developers to have knowledge of multi-threaded programming and thanks to this it is very widespread. Can similar technical work be used when working with EclipseStore? Of course, elegantly, very simply and safely we can use the ObjectCopier utility to create a deep copy of our data, change it, and save it back. Very simple idea, just create a purchase of actual data to work within the application and at the end save that data back. Unfortunately, it’s not that simple. If the standard copy function is called over an object in Java, it creates a copy of that object, but the other object’s references remain the same. This doesn’t help so much. Because usually, an application contains a more complex data structure than a single object. This approach is called shallow copy. More here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying What is actually needed at this point is a deep copy. You need to create a complete copy of the complete subgraph from this object. EclipseStore provides full support for a deep copy. It can be relatively easily called and a deep copy of the data will be created. The ObjectCopier is part of the eclipse serializer. pom.xml org.eclipse.serializer serializer 2.0.0 To create a deep copy just create a ObjectCopier and use its copy method.

Just create an instance of ObjectCopier class with factory method New(); Get the customer Make a deep copy of the customer object Modify this object graph In synchronized mode save this customer instead of the original customer and store it into a datastore This simple example written in pseudocode aims to demonstrate one of the many ways to solve working over a shared object graph in a multi-threaded environment.

But the managing thread accessing it can. When an EmbeddedStorageManager is \"started\" it is actually just setup with all kinds of default and user-defined settings and definitions. What is actually \"started\" are the database managing threads that process storing and loading requests. // Setup the database manager and start the managing threads EmbeddedStorageManager storageManager = EmbeddedStorage.start(); Of course, for every start() method, there needs to be something like a shutdown() method. So there is in EclipseStore: // Stop accessing the database storageManager.shutdown(); But is it really necessary to call shutdown? Should it be? What if there’s an error and the process stops without calling shutdown()? Will that cause the database to become inconsistent, corrupted, maybe even destroyed? The answer is: It wouldn’t be much of a database solution if a crash could cause any problem in the persisted data. EclipseStore data-store is carefully designed in such a fashion that the process it runs in can simply vanish at any point in time and the persisted data will never be corrupted. This is surprisingly simple and reliable to solve: Whenever a .store() call returns, it is guaranteed that the data stored by it has been physically written to the underlying storage layer, usually a file system. Before that, there is no guarantee regarding written data at all. In fact, should the process die before the last byte has been written and secured, the next StorageManager initialization will recognize that and truncate the last partially written store. Either way, all the data that was guaranteed to be written will be consistently available after the next .start(). As a consequence, this safety mechanism makes an explicit .shutdown() call pretty much unnecessary. It doesn’t hurt, but it is effectively more-less the same as just calling System.exit(0);. The only time when an explicit shutdown is really needed is, if the database managing threads shall be stopped but the application itself keeps running. For example, it is perfectly valid to start the StorageManager, work with the database, then stop it, maybe change some configuration or copy files or something like that and then start it up again to continue working. In any other case, the shutdown method can be ignored and the live database can happily just be \"killed\" while running. It is specifically designed to withstand such a treatment. Any live EclipseStore database basically consists of three major parts: A place where the persisted data is located. Usually a file system directory. The managing threads accessing (read and write) the persisted data. The EmbeddedStorageManager instance to use and control the database in the application. Apart from a lot of internal components (configuration, processing logic, housekeeping state, etc.), that’s all there is. There is nothing special or \"magic\" about it, no static state, no global registration in the JVM process or something like that. The consequence of this is: If two EmbeddedStorageManager instances are started, each one with a different location for its persistend data, then the application has two live databases! If three or ten or 100 are started, then that’s the number of live databases the application has. There is no limit and no conflict between different databases inside the same application process. The only important thing is that no two running StorageManagers can access the same data location.","title":"Application Life-Cycle","component":"manual","version":"master","name":"application-life-cycle","url":"/manual/storage/application-life-cycle.html","titles":[{"text":"Stopping or Crashing a Live Database","hash":"_stopping_or_crashing_a_live_database","id":1},{"text":"Multiple Databases","hash":"_multiple_databases","id":2}]},"141":{"id":141,"text":"Deleting data does not require performing explicit deleting actions like DELETE FROM table WHERE…​.

In line 6 the current storage’s content is printed. Line 7 assigns some data to the storage, replacing existing data if there is some. In line 8 everything gets stored. When using EclipseStore, your entire database is accessed starting at a root instance. This instance is the root object of an object graph that gets persisted by the EclipseStore storage logic. While the root instance can be of any type (for example just a collection or an array), it is a good idea to define an explicit root type specific for the application. In this simple example, it is a class called DataRoot, which wraps a single String. public class DataRoot { private String content; public DataRoot() { super(); } public String getContent() { return this.content; } public void setContent(final String content) { this.content = content; } @Override public String toString() { return \"Root: \" + this.content; } } For further information, see root instances. The following code is all that is required to setup a an application backed by a EclipseStore database.

This is a fully operational Java database application. // Application-specific root instance final DataRoot root = new DataRoot(); // Initialize a storage manager (\"the database\") with the given directory. final EmbeddedStorageManager storageManager = EmbeddedStorage.start( root, // root object Paths.get(\"data\") // storage directory ); // Set content data to the root element, including the time to visualize // changes on the next execution. root.setContent(\"Hello World! @ \" + new Date()); // Store the modified root and its content. storageManager.storeRoot(); This call is all that is necessary to store data in the simplest case. Best practice is to safely shutdown the storage manager by simply calling: storageManager.shutdown(); storageManager.storeRoot() is a special case method that always stores the root object.

It is comprised of mechanisms for cleaning up storage files, clearing unneeded cached data and recognizing deleted entities via garbage collection. Housekeeping is performed with a configurable time budget in configurable intervals to make sure it never interferes with the application’s work load too much (see housekeeping configuration). If new versions of an entity are stored or if entities become no longer reachable (meaning the become effectively deleted or \"garbage\" data), their older data is no longer needed. However, the byte sequences representing that old data still exist in the storage files. But since they will never be needed again, they become logical \"gaps\" in the storage files. Space that is occupied, but will never be read again. It might as well be all zeroes or not exist at all. Sadly, unwanted areas cannot simple by \"cut\" from files. Above all because that would ruin all file offsets coming after them. So with every newly stored version of an entity and every entity that is recognized as unreachable \"garbage\", a storage file consists more and more of useless \"gaps\" and less and less of actually used data. This makes the storage space less and less efficient. To prevent eventually ending up with a drive that is filled with useless bytes despite an actually not that big database, the files need to be \"cleaned up\" from time to time. To do this, the Housekeeping occasionally scans the storage files. If their \"payload\" ratio goes below the configured limit, the affected files will be retired: all data that belongs to still live entities is copied to a new file. Then the old file consists of 100% unneeded gap data and can safely be deleted. Which ratio value to set in the configuration is a matter of taste or, more precisely, depends on each individual application’s demands. A value of 1.0 (100%) means: only files with 100% payload, so no gaps at all, are acceptable. This means that for every store that contains at least one new version of an already existing entity, the corresponding storage file will contain the slightest gap, thus dropping below the demanded ratio of 100% and as a consequence, will be retired on the next occasion. This very aggressive cleanup strategy will keep the disc space usage at a perfect minimum, but at the cost of enormous amounts of copied data, since virtually every store will cause one or more storage files to be retired and their content be shifted into a new file. Respectively, a value of 0.0 (0%) means something like: \"Never care about gaps, just fill up the disc until it bursts.\" This keeps the disc write loads for the file cleanup at 0, but at the cost of rapidly eating up disc space. The best strategy most probably lies somewhere in between. Somewhere between 0.1 and 0.9 (10% and 90%). The default value is 0.75 (75%). So a storage file containing up to 25% of unused gap data is okay. Containing more gaps that 25% will cause a storage file to be retired. In addition to the payload ratio check, the file cleanup also retired files tha are too small or too big. For example: The application logic might commit a single store that is 100 MB in size. But the storage files are configured to be no larger than 10 MB (for example to keep a single file cleanup nice and fast). A single store is always written as a whole in the currently last storage file. The reason for this is to process the store as fast as possible and quickly return control to the application logic. When the housekeeping file cleanup scan encounters such an oversized file, it will retire it immediately by splitting it up across 10 smaller files and then deleting the oversized file. A similar logic applies to files that are too small. Upper and lower size bounds can be freely configured to arbitrary values. The defaults are 1 MB and 8 MB. To avoid repeated reads to storage files (which are incredibly expensive compared to just reading memory), data of once loaded entities is cached in memory. If an entity’s cached data is not requested again for a certain amount of time in relation to how much data is already cached, it is cleared from the cache to avoid unnecessarily consuming memory. The mechanism to constantly evaluate and clear cached data where applicable, is part of the housekeeping. The aggressiveness of this mechanism can be configured via the housekeeping configuration. In a reference-based (or graph-like) data paradigm, instances never have to be deleted explicitly. For example, there is no \"delete\" in the java language. There are only references. If those references are utilized correctly, deleting can be done fully automatically without any need for the developer to care about it. This is called \"garbage collection\". The concept is basically very simple: when the last reference to an instance is cut, that instance can never be accessed again. It becomes \"garbage\" that occupies memory with it data that is not needed any longer. To identify those garbage instances, all an algorithm (the \"garbage collector\") has to do is to follow every reference, starting at some defined root instance (or several) of a graph and mark every instance it encounters as \"reachable\". When it has no more unvisited instances in its queue, the marking is completed. Every instance that is not marked as reachable by then must be unreachable garbage and will be deleted from memory. Similar to the JVM’s garbage collection to optimize its memory consumption, EclipseStore has a garbage collection of its own, but for the level of persistent storage space instead of memory space. Housekeeping can also be triggered manually from the StorageConnection . Related methods are: issueCacheCheck(nanoTimeBudgetBound) issueCacheCheck(nanoTimeBudgetBound, entityEvaluator) issueFileCheck(nanoTimeBudgetBound) issueFileCheck(nanoTimeBudgetBound, fileDissolvingEvaluator) issueFullCacheCheck() issueFullCacheCheck(entityEvaluator) issueFullFileCheck() issueFullFileCheck(fileDissolvingEvaluator) issueFullGarbageCollection() issueGarbageCollection(nanoTimeBudget) All Housekeeping methods can be given a defined time budget or can be run until full completion.","title":"Housekeeping","component":"manual","version":"master","name":"housekeeping","url":"/manual/storage/housekeeping.html","titles":[{"text":"File cleanup:","hash":"_file_cleanup","id":1},{"text":"Cache cleanup","hash":"_cache_cleanup","id":2},{"text":"Garbage collection","hash":"_garbage_collection","id":3},{"text":"Explicit Housekeeping","hash":"_explicit_housekeeping","id":4}]},"144":{"id":144,"text":"EclipseStore provides an API to import and export persisted data of the storage.

From a technical point of view it serves one purpose only: To fully or partially persist and restore a Java object graph in the simplest way possible for the user. EclipseStore is a storage engine, but no database management system (DBMS). Many features that typical DBMS provide have been left out on purpose. The reason is that those features exist to make a DBMS something of a server application platform of an \"old kind\" on top of its data store functionality: A standalone process with user management, connection management, session handling, often even with a programming language of its own, a querying interface (SQL), etc. Today, all of those server application features are already and much better handled by dedicated server applications (the \"new kind\"), implemented in a modern language like Java. They have their built-in user, connection and session management, the querying interface to the outside world are typically web services instead of SQL, etc. But those modern server applications still lack one important thing: an easy to use and technically efficient way to store and restore their application’s data. So a \"new kind\" server often uses an \"old kind\" server just to do the data storing. This comes at the price of catching all the overhead and problems of redundant user, connection and session management AND the outdated concepts and limitations of the old querying interface (SQL). Isn’t that very weird and frustratingly complicated? Why not simply include a modern data storing library in the modern server and be done with it? A storing library that perfectly fits the modern technology and brings in no redundant overhead or complication of a secondary outdated wannabe server process. This is exactly what EclipseStore is and the reason why it is intentionally not a DBMS but \"only\" a storage engine. One might think the easiest way to store and load data in Java would be Java’s built-in serialization. However, it turned out long ago to be very limited, making it hard, if not impossible, to be used as a replacement for a DBMS: Only complete object graphs can be stored and restored, which is unacceptable for all but very small databases. It is very inefficient in terms of storage size and performance. It does not handle changing class structures very well, basically forbidding classes of persisted entities to ever change or introducing massive manual effort to compensate. It cannot handle third-party classes that do not implement Serializable but cannot be changed. In short: The Java Serialization is not an acceptable data store solution and hence no valid replacement for those outdated DBMS. EclipseStore is such a solution: It can persist, load or update object graphs partially and on-demand. It is very efficient both size- and performance-wise. It handles changing class structures by mapping data in the old structure to the current structure during loading; implicitly via internal heuristics or explicitly via a user-defined mapping strategy. It can automatically handle any Java constructs, only excluding those that are technically or reasonably not persistable (e.g. lambdas, proxies or instances with ties to JVM-internals like threads, etc.). EclipseStore is what the Java Serialization should have been and it is the first and only really fitting data storing solution for modern applications, completely removing the need to attach a wannabe secondary server DBMS just to store data.","title":"Storage","component":"manual","version":"master","name":"index","url":"/manual/storage/index.html","titles":[]},"146":{"id":146,"text":"The EclipseStore engine takes care of persisting your object graph.

Somewhere you have a foundation instance, a foundation in where everything is configured, from which the StorageManager is created. EmbeddedStorageFoundation foundation = EmbeddedStorage.Foundation(); // or from somewhere else It itself contains a foundation for connections. To access the inner thing needs a little detour. Incidentally, that’s not a JDBC connection, but this is just one thing that creates helper instances like Storer and Loader. Because Legacy Type Mapping affects loading, it has to go in there. Either you access it directly, like this: EmbeddedStorageConnectionFoundation f = foundation.getConnectionFoundation(); Or like this, that’s better for method chaining. foundation.onConnectionFoundation(f -> { ... }); If you have that, the configuration for the Legacy Type Mapping callback logic is just a one liner: f.setLegacyTypeMappingResultor(...); Default PersistenceLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New() That’s just the necessary logic, without anything further. If you do not change anything, this is done by default. With Console Output PrintingLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New(PersistenceLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New()) That wraps a printer around the necessary logic. All these storage and persistence classes are nothing sacred or super-duper intertwined or anything. These are just interfaces and if you plug in another implementation then it will be used. Inquiry InquiringLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New(PersistenceLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New()) Resultor which asks the user to apply. More customization is possible, see below. And so on With the implementation of just one single interface method, you can build anything else you can imagine. For example, logging to a file instead of the console. Or in the personally preferred logging framework. Or write confirmed mappings into the refactorings file. Everything is possible. For the inquiring implementation (InquiringLegacyTypeMappingResultor) there are a few settings: When should he ask? Always or only if something is unclear. Never does not make any sense of course, then you shouldn’t use it, or alternatively the printing resultor. When is a mapping unclear? If at least one field mapping is not completely clear. A field mapping is clear if: If two fields are exactly the same (similarity 1.0 or 100%) Or if two fields are specified by the explicit mapping. So if all fields are clear according to the above rule, then there is no need to ask. And there is another special case: If a field is discarded that is not explicitly marked as discardable, then as a precaution an inquiry is always done. Although no data is lost, but the data would not be available in the application, so better ask. There are options to control this a bit finer. You can optionally specify a double as a threshold (from 0.0 to 1.0, otherwise Exception): The value determines how similar two matching fields automatically have to be so that they are not inquired. Example: The value is 0.9 (90%), but a match found is only 0.8 (80%) similar. This is according to the specification too little, there must be an inquiry as a precaution. If you specify 1.0, that means: always ask, everything is really perfectly clear. If you enter 0.0, this means: never ask or only for implicitly dropping fields. Looks like this: InquiringLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New( PersistenceLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New()) // implicitely 1.0 InquiringLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New( PersistenceLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New(), 0.7) // 0.7 threshold Here a small example with a Person class. int customerid ; // -> pin String firstname ; // -> firstName String surname ; // -> lastName String comment ; // discarded, NOT new commerceId It should be changed to: Integer pin ; // firstName surname -0,688----> lastName comment -0,750----> commerceId [***new***] address customerid [discarded] customerid and pin are too different to be automatically assigned to each other. Therefore, it is wrongly assumed that customerid is omitted and pin is new. comment and commerceId are surprisingly similar (75%) and are therefore assigned. But that’s not what we want. Incidentally, it would not matter here what is defined as a threshold: customerid would be eliminated by the implicit decision. This is too delicate not to inquire, so it is always necessary to ask. To get the mapping right, you have to specify two entries: customerid is now called pin and comment should be omitted Then the inquiry looks like this: customerid -[mapped]-> pin firstname -0,944----> firstName surname -0,688----> lastName [***new***] commerceId [***new***] address comment [discarded] Due to the explicit mapping from customerid to pin, the similarity does not matter, it is the mapping that matters. To indicate this, it says \"[mapped]\" instead of the similarity. The rest is as usual. Only comment is now \"[discarded]\", according to the mapping. The difference to the above is namely: This is an explicitly predetermined absence. That does not force inquiry. This clears the way for the threshold: If you enter 0.7 or more then you will be asked. As far as everything would be clear, but the mapping of surname to lastName is below the required \"minimum similarity\", so rather ask. If you enter 0.6 or less, you will no longer be asked. Because all assignments are either explicitly specified or they are according to \"minimum similarity\" similar enough to rely on it. A recommendation for a good value for the \"minimum similarity\" is difficult. As soon as one softens rules, there is always the danger of a mistake. See comment example above: is 75% similar to commerceId. Still wrong. Then prefer 80%? Or 90%? Of course it is better, but the danger is still there. If you want to be sure, just make 1.0 or omit the parameter, then by default 1.0 is taken. The most important is the explicit mapping anyway : if \"enough\" is given by the user, there is no need to ask.","title":"User Interaction","component":"manual","version":"master","name":"user-interaction","url":"/manual/storage/legacy-type-mapping/user-interaction.html","titles":[]},"155":{"id":155,"text":"Loading data can be done in two ways, eager and Lazy.

When called, the reference held in the Lazy Reference is removed and only the ID is kept so that the instance can be reloaded when needed. Important background knowledge: However, such a clear does not mean that the referenced instance immediately disappears from memory. That’s the job of the garbage collector of the JVM. The reference is even registered in another place, namely in a global directory (Swizzle Registry), in which each known instance is registered with its ObjectId in a bijective manner. This means: if you clear such a reference, but shortly thereafter the Lazy Reference is queried again, probably nothing has to be loaded from the database, but simply the reference from the Swizzle Registry is restored. Nevertheless, the Swizzle Registry is not a memory leak, because it references the instances only via WeakReference. In short, if an instance is only referenced as \"weak,\" the JVM GC will still clean it up. So that the Lazy References do not have to be managed manually, but the whole goes automatically, there is the following mechanism: Each Lazy instance has a lastTouched timestamp. Each .get() call sets it to the current time. This will tell you how long a Lazy Reference has not been used, i.e. if it is needed at all. The LazyReferenceManager audits this. It is enabled by default, with a timeout of 1,000,000 milliseconds, which is about 15 minutes. A custom manager can be set easily, which should happen before a storage is started.

Of course, it’s not really about the technical implementation of procrastination, but about efficiency: why bloat the limited RAM with stuff before you even need it? Classic example: The application has self-contained data areas that contain a large amount of data. The data for an area is not loaded if the area is not worked at all. Instead, you only load a tiny amount of \"head data\" for each area (name or other for displaying purposes) and the actual data only when the application really needs it. E.g. fiscal years with hundreds of thousands or millions of sales. One million revenue records for 2010, one million for 2011, for 2012, etc. In 2019, most of the time only 2019 and 2018 will be needed. The previous few, and the year 2000 sales are not of great interest anymore. Therefore: load data only when needed. Super efficient. For example let’s say the app \"MyBusinessApp\" has a root instance class, looking like this: public class MyBusinessApp { // ... private HashMap businessYears = new HashMap<>(); // ... } The business year hold the turnovers: public class BusinessYear { // ... private ArrayList turnovers = new ArrayList<>(); // ... } This approach would be a problem: During initialization, the root instance would be loaded, from there its HashMap with all BusinessYear instances, each with its ArrayList and thus all conversions. For all years. 20 years of approximately 1 million sales makes 20 million entities, which are pumped directly into the RAM at the start. It does not matter if someone needs it or not. We don’t want it that way. It would be nice if you could simply add a \"lazy\" to the turnover list. And that’s exactly how it works: public class BusinessYear { // ... private Lazy> turnovers = ...; // we will get to that // ... } And bingo, the turnovers are now loaded lazily. Of course, this is no longer an ArrayList field, which is now magically loaded lazy, but this is now a Lazy field and the instances of this type are typed generically to ArrayList . Lazy is just a simple class whose instances internally hold an ID and a reference to the actual thing (here the ArrayList instance). If the internal reference is zero, the reserved ID is used to reload it. If it is not null, it is simply returned. So just a reference intermediate instance. Similar to the JDK’s WeakReference, just not JVM-weak, but storage-lazy. What do you have to do now to get the actual ArrayList instance? ArrayList turnovers = this.turnovers.get(); Just as with WeakReference, or simply as one would expect from a reference intermediate type in general: a simple get method. The .get() call reloads the data as needed. But you do not want to mess around with that yourself. No \"SELECT bla FROM turnovers WHERE ID =\" + this.turnovers.getId(). Since you want to program your application you don' t have to mess around with low-level database ID-loading stuff. That’s what the EclipseStore Code does internally. You do not even need to access the ID, you just have to say \"get!\". That’s it. There are different strategies, what you write here. Analogous to the code example before it would be simply: private Lazy> turnovers = Lazy.Reference(new ArrayList<>()); So always a new ArrayList instance, wrapped in a Lazy instance. If the actual ArrayList reference should be null at first, it works the same way: private Lazy> turnovers = Lazy.Reference(null); The this.turnovers.get() also just always returns null. Completely transparent. But you could also do this: private Lazy> turnovers = null; If there is no list, then you do not make any intermediate reference instance for any list. A separate instance for null is indeed a bit …​ meh. But that has a nasty problem elsewhere: this.turnovers.get() does not work then. Because NullPointerException. Anytime you need to write this here, the readability of code is not exactly conducive: return this.turnovers == null ? null : this.turnovers.get(); But there is a simple solution: Just move this check into a static utility method. Just like that: return Lazy.get(this.turnovers); This is the same .get(), just with a static null-check around it. This always puts you on the safe side. For Lazy Loading, simply wrap Lazy<> around the actual field and then call .get() or maybe better Lazy.get(...). It’s as simple as that. The full example can be found on GitHub. Why do you have to replace your actual instance with a lazy loading intermediate instance and fiddle around with generics? Why is not something like this: @Lazy private ArrayList turnovers = new ArrayList<>(); Put simply: If it were just that it would be bare Java bytecode for accessing an ArrayList. There would be no way for a middleware library to get access and look it up and perhaps reload it. What’s written there is an ArrayList reference. There is no lazy anymore. Either, the instance is null, or it is not null. If you wanted to reach in there, you would have to start with bytecode manipulation. Technically possible, but something you really don’t want in your application. So there must always be some form of intermediary. Hibernate solves this through its own collection implementations that do lazy loading internally. Although the lazy loading is nicely hidden in some way (or not, if you need an annotation for that), it also comes with all sorts of limitations. You can only use interfaces instead of concrete classes for collections. At first, the instance is not the one you dictate, the code becomes non-transparent and difficult to debug, you have to use a collection, even if it’s just a single instance, and so on. You want to be able to write anything you want and you want full insight and control (debugability, etc.) over the code. All this can be done with the tiny Lazy Interim Reference class. No restrictions, no incomprehensible \"magic\" under the hood (proxy instances and stuff) and also usable for individual instances.","title":"Lazy Loading","component":"manual","version":"master","name":"index","url":"/manual/storage/loading-data/lazy-loading/index.html","titles":[{"text":"What about the \"…​\" ?","hash":"_what_about_the","id":1},{"text":"In Short","hash":"_in_short","id":2},{"text":"Side Note","hash":"_side_note","id":3}]},"165":{"id":165,"text":"A List, Map, or Set is a single entity within $EclipseStore. So this means that all data are loaded at once into memory. This can be an issue if you have a very large collection, like a list with several millions of Customers. That is why we recommend splitting up large lists using an indexing strategy like a HashMap that contains a Lazy list of data as value. Or, when more advanced functionality is required, you can make use of an Apache Lucene index that efficiently determines which data needs to be loaded. The Lazy collections that are added to the library can help you to maintain a larger block of data in a more memory-efficient way. The implementation might need to load and unload data (when there is not enough memory), so access time to the data might be slightly increased. No additional configuration is required to make use of these Lazy Collections. The Binary Handlers to correctly write and read the Lazy Collections to and from the data storage are already configured by default. When you need to instantiate an instance, you can just call the default constructor. The instance you receive implements the standard Java collection interface that you expect based on the name of the class. new LazyArrayList(); new LazyHashSet(); new LazyHashMap(); The default constructor takes a value of 1000 items in each segment. This is not a hard limit since various factors, like the hash collision with a Map, can result in the fact that more elements are maintained in a segment. You can specify the number of items that should be maintained by specifying this value as a constructor parameter. Note that small values, like smaller than 100, or large values, like 1_000_000 and more, might negatively impact the performance. As mentioned, the implementation stores the data in different segments which are lazily operated. Initially, at the startup of the StorageManager, the data is not yet loaded into memory and your object graph. When accessing the values, it loads the required segments to fulfil your request. Depending on how you access the data, it might be that all segments need to be loaded. Since they behave like Lazy objects, they can be unloaded by the Garbage collector if needed when the memory consumption of your Java application is high. Some aspects of the implementations The size property is cached, so calling for the amount of data in the collection doesn’t need to load the segments. Accessing the LazyHashMap by a key value will load at maximum log2(n) segments when the implementation uses n segments since the search is implemented as btree.","title":"Lazy collections","component":"manual","version":"master","name":"lazy-collections","url":"/manual/storage/loading-data/lazy-loading/lazy-collections.html","titles":[{"text":"Background","hash":"background","id":1},{"text":"Configuration","hash":"config","id":2},{"text":"Using","hash":"use","id":3},{"text":"Internals","hash":"_internals","id":4}]},"166":{"id":166,"text":"For convenience EclipseStore provides Null-safe static access methods for lazy references.

There are two strategies for a simplified type handler implementation. Implementing a class that extends CustomBinaryHandler and defines a sequence of BinaryFields via the #Field~ static pseudo-constructor methods. Everything else like setting the name, calculating the binary offsets, etc. is then done implicitly via reflection. Example on GitHub This example implements a custom type handler for the java.awt.image.BufferedImage class. Instead of storing the rather complex object structure of that class the image is serialized as PNG image format using javax.imageio.ImageIO into a byte array. This byte array is then stored by EclipseStore. The custom type handler must be registered in the CustomTypeHandlerRegistry to enable it: EmbeddedStorageManager storage = EmbeddedStorage .Foundation(WORKINGDIR) .onConnectionFoundation(f -> f.registerCustomTypeHandlers(new CustomBufferedImageHandler()) ) .start(ROOT); Implementing a class can be skipped altogether by using the method Binary#TypeHandler and passing the BinaryFields directly. Registering such a generically created TypeHandler is not required. Just define a static method in the entity class that will be recognized and used by EclipseStore. The following is a simple technical example on how a custom binary handler can be easily defined and technically leveraged to optimize storage behavior. E.g. imagine having millions of such objects that now only create 1 database record with a fraction of the required storage space instead of 4 records but hold the same information. public class Employee { /* * Fields with primitive data are (for whatever reason, e.g. project * design rules) all object types, but records should be stored as * efficient as possible, i.e. without overhead of references and value objects. * * EclipseStore's generic type analysis does not know of this and hence cannot * do it. But defining a custom type handler can */ String id ; Double salary ; Date dateOfBirth; // constructor, getters, setters, etc /* * The entity class must just contain \"any\" method returning a suitable type * handler and EclipseStore will recognize it and use the returned handler * automatically. * * Type type handler just needs to specify the entity class and define a list * of fields comprised of (name, getter, setter) in arbitrary order. */ static BinaryTypeHandler provideTypeHandler() { return Binary.TypeHandler( Employee.class, Binary.Field_long(\"id\", e -> Long.parseLong(e.id), (e, value) -> e.id = String.valueOf(value) ), Binary.Field_long(\"dateOfBirth\", e -> e.dateOfBirth.getTime(), (e, value) -> e.dateOfBirth = new Date(value) ), Binary.Field_double(\"salary\", e -> e.salary.longValue(), (e, value) -> e.salary = Double.valueOf(value) ) ); } } Full example is available on GitHub.","title":"Custom Type Handler","component":"manual","version":"master","name":"custom-type-handler","url":"/manual/storage/customizing/custom-type-handler.html","titles":[{"text":"Implementation","hash":"_implementation","id":1},{"text":"A Custom Binary Handler","hash":"_a_custom_binary_handler","id":2},{"text":"A Static Provider Method","hash":"_a_static_provider_method","id":3}]},"183":{"id":183,"text":"When a reference to the loading storage is needed in entities, e.g. usage of different tenants or to store its internal state in a tailored fashion, this can be done by this little trick. If an entity type contains one or more transient fields with field type compatible to Persister, the updating processing during loading will set the Persister instance (e.g. an EmbeddedStorageManager instance) used to load the entity instance to those fields. The fields must be transient to exclude them from the persistent form of the entity. Checking for transient fields is only the default implementation. The checking logic can be customized via PersistenceFoundation#setFieldEvaluatorPersistable. A more precise check for Persister fields can be customized via PersistenceFoundation#setFieldEvaluatorPersister. Note, however, that the check for compatibility with the Persister type is done in any case to avoid inconsistencies/crashes. If no applicable field is found, nothing happens and no additional meta data is kept in memory. This feature is completely optional. class MyEntity { String name ; int value; transient Persister persister; } Upon loading an instance of class MyEntity, a reference to the Persister used to load it is set to its field persister.","title":"Optional Storage Manager Reference in
